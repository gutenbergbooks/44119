<h2>DEDICATION.</h2>


<p class="center"><small>TO THE</small><br />

<big>RIGHT REV. CHARLES RICHARD,</big><br />
LORD BISHOP OF WINCHESTER.</p>


<p>
<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>I have been induced to solicit the honour
of dedicating this little work to your Lordship
from the conviction that its contents are not only
consonant with the Doctrines and Articles of
that Church of which your Lordship is so bright
an ornament, but that they are in unison with
the truths of Divine Revelation, that perfect
standard by which all Theology and Morality
must be judged. My object in presenting it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
the Public is a wish to render the Scriptures more
familiar to the young: and while I feel grateful
for the honour of your Lordship's sanction, allow
me to express my sincere thanks for the favour
you have conferred on one who is, with the
greatest respect,</p>

<p class="sig">
My Lord,<br />
Your Lordship's very obliged Servant,<br />
<span class="smcap">The Authoress</span>.</p>

<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>Custom demands a preface; and though the
public is generally uninterested in the reasons
which influence an author to appear before its
tribunal, yet an introductory notice is usually
expected.</p>

<p>This little work was the employment of many
a retired moment. In turning over the pages of
the sacred volume, the writer was struck with the
exact fulfilment in the person of the Messiah, as
narrated in the New Testament, of the numerous
predictions recorded of him in the Old. These
were collected for her personal gratification;
and as they accumulated, it occurred, that what
had been some little source of pleasure to her
own mind, might, by the blessing of God, prove
useful to some young persons, who from circumstances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
are debarred access to, or are not inclined
to read, works of a more extensive kind.</p>

<p>While the writer has no disposition to despise
that criticism which, if impartially administered,
is the best safeguard of the press, neither would
she timidly shrink from investigation; aware that
no partiality of friends can long buoy up an unworthy
production.</p>

<p>This is not intended as the language of indifference,
but arises from a consciousness of the
purity of motive, and the desire to do good,
which have actuated her; compared with which,
all other considerations are momentary and
unsatisfying.</p>

<h2>JESUS, THE MESSIAH.</h2>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>I will put enmity between thee and the Woman, and
between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and
thou shalt bruise his heel.&mdash;Gen. iii. 15.</p></blockquote>


<p>This is the first intimation we meet with of the
promised Messiah, and within this one verse is contained,
as in the bud, the embryo flower, that goodly
plant of renown,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> which the Lord hath planted, and
not man; he who is the rose of Sharon and the
valley's lily.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It is an epitome of the whole plan of
Redemption, and contains truths of the first importance;
we shall do well to consider them in reference
to Jesus of Nazareth. The prophecy declares there
shall be enmity between the seed of the woman and
the serpent. The incarnation and birth of Jesus have,
by the Evangelists Matthew and Luke, been so fully
stated, that none but a strongly prejudiced mind can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
deny that he was the son of Mary, then a virgin,
and that Joseph was only his supposed father, because
he married his mother.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The old serpent, or as he
is frequently called, Satan, discovered his enmity
towards Jesus from his birth; he stirred up the mind
of Herod to destroy the holy child, Jesus, and thus
originated the massacre of the infants of Bethlehem.
Though disappointed, he personally attempted his
destruction, and for forty days and nights did he try
the force of his arts to tempt Jesus to sin.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> And,
though foiled, he again resumed the attack, and suggested
to the minds of the Scribes and Pharisees,
priests and people, to persecute the man "who spake
as never man spake." It is said he entered into,
<em>i.e.</em> took full possession of, the mind of Judas,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> who
betrayed Jesus, and also acted as guide to those who
took him. Was not Satan the ringleader of those
who crucified him, in whom his Judges declared, they
could find no fault worthy of death? Let us now
behold the opposition displayed by Jesus towards the
serpent and his seed. A great part of his life appears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
to have been spent in casting out and dispossessing
devils from the minds and bodies of men;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and in
rebuking and threatening them, he proved that he
came to destroy the power and works of darkness.
His was an avowed and constant war, and the devils
knew him as their greatest foe, and the destroyer of
their power.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Although the heel, <em>i.e.</em> the human
nature of Jesus, was bruised in the contest, yet, by
his death, (in which Satan for the moment appeared
triumphant,) he gave a mortal blow to his power and
authority, by delivering the captives of the mighty,
and the prey of the terrible one.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The cross, designed
to display their scorn and abhorrence, is become
the praise and glory of all the children of God, to
whom, as unto their Lord and Master, the old serpent
and his seed continue to manifest the same spirit of
enmity and persecution.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Did devils confess Jesus
to be the Son of the most high God, and shall not
we acknowledge him to be the seed promised at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
fall of man, and that he is, at the same time, Mary's
son, and the Son of God?<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The prince of the fallen
spirits, the old serpent, or Satan, discovered his
enmity to the human race in the garden of Eden;
the woman was the first whom he deceived by his
arts; but it was Jesus, her seed, who, in the after
ages of the world, in the garden of Gethsemane,
bruised the serpent's head, and at his resurrection, led
captivity captive, and will eventually consign to utter
darkness and perdition, this foe to God and man.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<hr class="chap" />


<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;
because thou hast obeyed my voice.&mdash;Gen. xxii. 18.</p></blockquote>


<p>We now meet with a prophecy of the family from
which Christ, after the flesh, should spring. The lineal
descent from Abraham to Joseph, the husband of Mary,
is given us by Matthew,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> through forty-two generations;
and Luke<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> gives the genealogy of Jesus back to Adam,
through Abraham, in the whole seventy-four generations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
showing at once that the seed promised to
Adam and Abraham, is the same, even Jesus in
whom all the nations of the earth shall be blessed.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
The reader will discover a difference between the
names in the Old and New Testaments, which arises
from the former being translated from the Hebrew,
and the latter from the Greek language. It will also
be observed, that the genealogies given by Matthew
and Luke differ, but Matthew gives the pedigree of
Joseph, and Luke that of Mary. Although the supposed
father of Jesus is said by Luke to be the son of
Heli, yet Matthew informs us Jacob begat Joseph,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
who is called the son of Heli, only on account of the
contract for marriage subsisting between Joseph and
his daughter. This was a custom prevalent with the
Jews, and these agreements were often made by
the parents, before the parties most interested had
ever seen each other, as was the case with Isaac and
Rebecca. Although Abraham's posterity have been,
as the sand on the sea shore, innumerable, and as
a nation have enjoyed exceeding great and precious
privileges, yet all the nations of the earth can never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
be said to be blessed in them, unless we take the
prophecy in its true light, as pointing to Jesus "the
promised blessing," whose day of "tabernacling" on
earth, Abraham by faith saw afar off, "rejoiced, and
was glad."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver
from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him
shall the gathering of the people be.&mdash;Gen. xlix. 10.</p></blockquote>


<p>The Holy Ghost, by the mouth of the dying patriarch,
Jacob, has pointed to the epoch when he, of
whom Moses and the prophets did write, should
appear. It is worthy our particular attention, that,
at the period of time when Jesus came, Judea was
still governed by a Jewish king. It is true the power
of the royal Asmonean or Maccabean race was destroyed,
and Herod the Great had ascended the
throne of Israel, yet the sceptre was not departed
from Judah. Herod was an Idumean, which nation
had, for nearly two centuries, been proselytes to Judaism,
and so incorporated and mingled with the
Jews, as to be regarded as one people. Judea bowed
to the Roman power, yet Herod exercised the regal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
authority, and was universally acknowledged as the
sovereign of Jewry, when Jesus, the prince of peace,
the king of Israel, appeared a babe at Bethlehem
but no sooner was the Shiloh come, than the sceptre
departed from Judah. On the death of Herod, which
happened soon after the birth of Christ, Augustus
C&#230;sar divided the kingdom of Judea between Archelaus,
Herod, and Philip, the three sons of Herod.
Archelaus succeeded to the half of his father's dominions
by the title of tetrarch, but not of king; his
tyranny and oppression were so great, that, in less than
ten years, he was deposed and banished to France by
the emperor, who then reduced Judea to a Roman
province, and ruled it afterwards by procurators or
governors, who were sent thither and recalled at
pleasure; the taxes were now paid more directly to
the Roman empire, and gathered by the publicans; the
power of life and death was taken out of the hands of
the Jews, and placed in those of the Roman governors.
The Lord, when he is pleased, can make the wrath
of man to praise him, and his enemies to minister to
his glory. This sentiment we have most strikingly illustrated
in the conduct of Caiaphas, who, in the
moment he was plotting the destruction of Jesus, and
thirsting for his blood, delivered a very remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
prophecy,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> the exact counterpart of the one we are
now considering, in which he declared Jesus to be
the promised Shiloh, who should gather together in
one, all the children of God which are scattered
abroad, not the nations of the Jews only, but the
Gentiles also. Yes, Jesus will seek out and bring his
people from the mountains whence they are scattered;
in the cloudy and dark day he will bring his
sons from afar, and his daughters from the ends of
the earth, and there shall be one fold under one
shepherd, even the glorious Shiloh.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse,
and a branch shall grow out of his roots. And in that day,
there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign
of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: and his rest shall
be glorious.&mdash;Isaiah xi. 1. 10.</p></blockquote>


<p>The Jews, from these prophecies, expected the
Messiah would spring from the family of David, the
son of Jesse; and this led them to preserve, with
unusual attention, the genealogy of his descendants.
We have abundant testimony that Jesus is of "the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
house and lineage of David."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> By comparing scripture
with scripture,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> we may venture to affirm, Jesus is
the "glorious branch" Jehovah hath made strong for
himself. With regard to his human and divine
nature, he is both "David's son and David's Lord."
He is the "root and offspring of David," and the
"bright and morning star." The Gentiles shall come
to "his light," and kings to the "brightness of his
rising." He is not only a "rod out of the stem of
Jesse," but he is the "tree of life" whose "leaves
are for the healing of the nations," whose top shall
"reach unto heaven," and his branches "cover the
earth." He is Jehovah's ensign of mercy displayed
to a rebel world, and both the Jewish and Gentile
nations are invited to enlist under the banners of the
cross. Those who seek an inheritance in the kingdom
of the true David, if it be agreeable to the charter of
Immanuel's land, shall find his rest to be glorious.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">&nbsp;</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>Thus saith the Lord, remove the diadem and take off the
crown, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.&mdash;Ezekiel
xxi. 26, 27.</p>

<p>For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a
king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without
an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim.
Afterwards shall the children of Israel return, and seek the
Lord their God, and David their king; and shall fear the Lord
and his goodness in the latter days.&mdash;Hosea iii. 4, 5.</p></blockquote>


<p>The Jews themselves must confess this prophecy
to be in part fulfilled. They are wanderers from
their beloved Canaan, strangers in a strange land,
scattered over all parts of the globe, and destitute of all
the local privileges which constitute a nation, although
they still retain a distinction of character; but it
only tends to make them a reproach, and their name
a by-word amongst all classes. They dwell alone, and
are not now reckoned amongst the nations of the earth.
The insignia of royal dignity are useless to them,
having no king or prince on whom to bestow the
crown or diadem. They are deprived of their temple
and its services, and of all the glorious distinctions
which marked it from those dedicated to false or
unknown Gods. The latter clause of this prophecy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
shall as assuredly be fulfilled, for heaven and earth
shall pass away, sooner than one of the promises of
God fail to be accomplished. Yes, the children of
Israel shall return, and seek the Lord their God, and
him of whom David was only a type, even King
Jesus,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> who is of David's royal line, "and the government
shall be upon his shoulders," for he is the
"wonderful counsellor, the mighty God, the everlasting
father, the prince of peace." Hasten, Lord! we would
say, the time "when the deliverer shall arise out of
Zion, and turn away ungodliness from Jacob." Assume
the sceptre of thy power, Jesus, thou king of Zion, thou
"Son of the Highest! for the Lord God has given unto
thee the throne of thy father, David; thou shalt reign
over the house of Jacob for ever." "Of the increase of
thy government and peace there shall be no end;
upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to
order it, and to establish it with judgment and with
justice, from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of
the Lord of hosts will perform this."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">&nbsp;</a></span></p>



<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from
the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye
shall hearken.&mdash;Deut. xviii. 15-19.</p></blockquote>


<p>This is one of the many precious promises given
by God to Israel. Moses is a character justly deserving
our regard and veneration. The Jewish nation
held him in high estimation, and almost idolized
his memory. Perhaps our time may not be misemployed
in searching for proofs of the fulfilment of this
prophecy, and in examining the character of one (even
Jesus) who declares himself to be not only a prophet
like unto Moses, but in every respect his superior;
which, if proved, will clearly warrant their giving
unto Jesus far greater honour than was even due to
Moses. In drawing a comparison between these illustrious
personages, we observe; they both sprang from
the family of Jacob or Israel; Moses, when a child,
was, for a time, concealed by his parents from the
persecuting Pharoah; the child Jesus also, was, by
command of God the Father, taken into Egypt, to
avoid the tyranny of Herod: thus both escaped the
destruction executed on all the other male children.
Moses was raised up from the midst of the people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
from amongst his brethren the children of Israel;
Jesus having taken on him our nature, is not ashamed
to call us brethren. Moses was a prophet, called and
taught of God; Jesus is the sent, the sealed, the
anointed of God, at whose call he came forth. Moses
saw God face to face; Jesus lay in the bosom of the
Father. Moses wrought miracles by the command
and aid of God; Jesus wrought many miracles in the
days of his flesh, but all in his own name and by his
own power. Moses was an honoured instrument in
bringing Israel from the bondage of Egypt; but Jesus
delivers his people Israel from worse than Egyptian
taskmasters, even the bondage of sin and Satan.
Moses fasted forty days before he gave the law to
Israel. Jesus fasted forty days before he entered on
his public ministry. When Moses wrought miracles
in Egypt, the magicians were obliged to confess the
divine power by which he acted. Jesus expelled the
evil spirits, and they acknowledged his almighty
power. Moses commanded the sea to retire, and it
obeyed his voice. Jesus said to the tempestuous winds
and sea, "Peace, be still!" and instantly there was
a great calm. Moses cured one leper.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Jesus cured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
many. Moses chose and appointed seventy elders
over the people, on whom God bestowed the spirit of
prophecy. Jesus chose seventy apostles, whom he
endowed with miraculous powers, and sent forth to
teach in the villages. Moses chose twelve men,
whom he sent to spy out the land the Israelites
were about to conquer. Jesus chose twelve apostles,
and commanded them to go forth and preach the
gospel to all the world, and subject it to his allegiance,
by a more glorious power than that of arms.
Moses was in danger of being stoned by the rebellious
and ungrateful people, whom he had constantly
laboured to benefit. The Jews also took up stones to
stone Jesus in return for his numerous favours. The
relations of Moses were greatly offended with him for
marrying an Ethiopian woman.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Jesus has espoused
the Gentile church, to the no small displeasure of the
Jews. When Moses was the prophet of Israel, they
were fed with manna from heaven. Jesus miraculously
fed five thousand and seven thousand persons; he could
say "I am the living bread which came down from
heaven; if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for
ever; and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
will give for the life of the world." When Moses, by
God's command, stretched forth his hand, darkness
covered the land of Egypt, which was shortly followed
by the awful destruction of its first-born; when Jesus was
crucified, darkness covered the land, which, not many
years after, was the scene of the most dire calamities.
Was Moses a prophet? and did he not speak of the
calamities that would befall the Jews? as such, see
Jesus teaching the people, and foretelling the time and
circumstances of his own decease, and also the siege
and destruction of Jerusalem. Was Moses as king in
Jeshurun? Jesus is not only king in Zion, but King
of kings, and Lord of lords; by him kings rule, and
princes decree justice. Moses is described as an
almost perfect character; Jesus as wholly free from
the least spot or stain of sin. Moses was remarkable
for meekness; Jesus, when led as a lamb to the
slaughter, opened not his mouth; when reviled, he
reviled not again; when persecuted, he blessed. Moses,
by command of God, gave laws and statutes,
and instituted ordinances in Israel; Jesus instituted
the ordinance of the Lord's Supper, and gave laws
and commandments to his people. The law given by
Moses tends only to condemnation, but Jesus "has
brought light and immortality to light by his gospel."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
The law of Moses was designed "as a schoolmaster to
bring us to Christ;" the doctrine of Jesus is, "I am
the way, the truth, and the life." Moses acted as a
mediator between God and Israel, at the giving of the
covenant on Sinai; Jesus is the great day's-man, and
the almighty mediator of the new covenant. Did Moses
plead for the rebellious Israelites? we also hear Jesus
interceding for transgressors, saying, "Father, forgive
them, for they know not what they do." Moses read
the law in the ears of all Israel; Jesus writes his
laws upon the hearts of his people, and his truths in
their inward parts. When Moses descended from
Mount Sinai, after holding converse with God, his
face shone exceeding bright; we are told when Jesus
was transfigured on Mount Tabor, his face shone as
the sun, and his raiment was white as the light. Did
Moses choose rather "to suffer affliction with the
people of God, than enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
season?" Jesus preferred suffering misery and woe for
a time, rather than his people should endure the everlasting
punishment which their sins deserved. Did
Moses esteem the reproach of Christ greater riches
than the treasures of Egypt? Jesus considers the
odium affixed to his cross, as a more honourable distinction
than the possession of thousands of gold and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
silver. Moses, as a servant, was faithful in all
his house; Jesus could say "Father, I have finished
the work thou hast given me to do," "I have glorified
thee on the earth," and "those thou gavest me, I have
kept, and none of them is lost." (See John xvii. 12)
Moses was permitted, from the heights of Pisgah, to
view the goodly land of promise; which was but a type
of the heavenly rest Jesus has prepared for those who
love him. Moses, as a prophet, was great in Israel;
Jesus is the Lord God of the prophets, and unto him
shall the people hearken; he will give them the hearing
ear and the understanding heart, and make them willing
in the day of his power. "Every soul that will not hearken
unto this prophet, shall be cut off," for be it known
to all people, "that there is none other name under
heaven given amongst men, whereby we can be saved,"
but that of Jesus, who is of a truth "the prophet
that was for to come." It was said, by way of
reproach, thou art this man's disciple, but we are
Moses' disciples. Let us not consider it a disgrace to
own our attachment to him, who is in every point of
view far superior to Moses, who was but his servant,
and the creature of his power. Where shall we find
a person who so closely resembles Moses, as Christ?
Surely he was the prophet foretold! Yet the Jews<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
rejected him, and by that rejection prove that Jesus
was he of whom Moses wrote&mdash;for the Lord has executed
the punishment he threatened should befall
them, if they refused to hearken unto this prophet;
thus the Jews are living monuments of the truth as it
is in Jesus. Oh, may we take warning from their
calamities, and receive the sent, the sealed, the
anointed of the Father, as our prophet, priest, and
king; even Jesus the Messiah, the Christ of God!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye
the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway
for our God.&mdash;Isaiah xl. 3.</p></blockquote>


<p>The Prophets Isaiah and Malachi<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> were commissioned
to inform the church, that when the period
should arrive for the coming of the Messiah, a messenger
would be sent to announce his near approach.
This promise was most strictly fulfilled: Jesus, the
Son of the Most High God, did not visit this our
world, without first directing an herald to proclaim his
coming; even John, who was sent to prepare the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
way before him.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> This harbinger deserves our attention;
he was no ordinary character. An angel, even
Gabriel, posted from heaven to speak of his birth, and
declare he should be filled with the Holy Ghost from
the first dawn of life. If such distinguishing honour
was paid to the messenger, how great that due to the
master! John demands our respect, on account of
the sanctity of his life, the simplicity of his manners,
and the active zeal and ardent love he manifested in
the cause, and towards the person, of his Lord, and
for the integrity and faithfulness exhibited in every
part of his conduct towards man. He feared not to
reprove sin in whatever class of persons he beheld it,
from the common soldier even to the monarch on the
throne. To a character so exemplary as John's, the
highest respect and veneration are due; and the testimony
of such a man deserves not to be lightly
regarded. John's birth was six months prior to his
Lord's,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and being the first who used water-baptism
as a divine ordinance, he was surnamed the Baptist.
He abode "in the deserts" of Judea "until the day of
his showing unto Israel," and had never seen his Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
(who resided at Nazareth, in Galilee), until he came
to Jordan for baptism. The testimony he then gave to
the person of Jesus merits observation. He publicly
acknowledged him to be the person whose way he was
sent to prepare, and spoke of him as one whose shoe's
latchet he was not worthy to unloose. We see John,
when surrounded by his own disciples, point to Jesus,
and say "Behold the Lamb of God which taketh
away the sin of the world," and "this is he of whom I
said, after me cometh a man which is preferred before
me; for he was before me." John gave the most
decided testimony to the Godhead of Jesus, for he said
he would "baptise with the Holy Ghost," which is the
prerogative only of God. What man can, by any
means, redeem his brother, or give to God a ransom
for his soul? but John spake of his Lord as "the
Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the
world." Yes, he is the "Lamb slain from the foundation
of the world." Under the Mosaic dispensation,
the lamb slain, as a morning and evening sacrifice, and
on the great day of atonement, was only a type of this
Lamb of God's own providing, who offered himself up
as a sacrifice for the sins of many. When the disciples
of John appeared displeased at the growing popularity
of Jesus, their master instantly checked them by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
saying "he must increase, but I must decrease; he
that cometh from heaven is above all." After John
was cast into prison, we find him sending two of his
disciples to Jesus, to inquire if he were the Christ or
not.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Having heard the testimony John had before
given to the person of Jesus, we cannot suppose he
had any doubts in his own mind as to his being the
Messiah, but rather that he was fully convinced of
the fact himself; and wishing his disciples to be firmly
established in the same faith, he, as the most effectual
method, sent them to Jesus for satisfactory proofs of a
truth which he (John) had been continually teaching
through the whole course of his ministry. John was
a faithful witness in his master's cause, and to him
we are much indebted. But let us not bestow on him
the honours due to Jesus, who is deservedly preferred
before him; for, as John justly observed, he was before
him. This is strictly true, for although Jesus did
not take on him our nature until six months after the
birth of John, yet, being God as well as man, his
existence is from everlasting to everlasting.</p>

<p>Josephus, in his history of the Jews, speaks of John
the Baptist in the highest terms of respect and veneration:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
he says he had acquired such credit and authority
amongst the people by the holiness of his life, and his
disciples were so numerous, that Herod, dreading a
revolt, confined John in the castle of Macharas, and
afterwards beheaded him, for no other crime than his
honest faithfulness.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Herod's army was soon after
totally routed by the troops of Aretas, and the Jews
considered it as a mark of Divine vengeance for his
cruel treatment of the Holy Baptist.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>Therefore, the Lord himself shall give you a sign, behold a
virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name
Immanuel.&mdash;Isaiah vii. 14.</p></blockquote>


<p>The portion of scripture now before us is highly interesting,
and demands serious attention. About seven
hundred and eight years before the birth of Jesus, the
prophet Isaiah was commissioned to tell the church, a
virgin should conceive and bear a son, and should call
his name Immanuel. For proofs of the fulfilment of
this prophecy, we would refer to Matthew and Luke,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
and request their testimony may be read with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
serious attention the subject demands. The unblushing
infidel may treat it with scorn and ridicule;
but let not one bearing the name of Christ,
venture to speak with lightness, on this so highly
momentous an article of the christian faith. We
cannot suppose the Lord, after giving this promise,
would be unmindful of its accomplishment: if the
birth of Christ had been the result of natural causes,
there would have been nothing to excite surprise, nor
would it have been a sign, as the Lord himself
declared it should be. If he had been born after the
manner of the children of men, no doubt he must have
partaken of their evil nature. Or if his body had
been formed of the dust, as was Adam's, how could
the promise given at the fall of man, have been
fulfilled? And what relationship would there then
have existed between Christ and his church? But
now he is "bone of our bone, and flesh of our flesh."
For in the fulness of time, "God sent forth his son,
made of a woman, made under the law, that he might
redeem them which are under the law." "Lo! in the
volume of the book, it is written of him," "sacrifice
and offerings for sin, thou wouldest not; but a body
hast thou prepared for him." A body subject to all
the infirmities of our nature, yet wholly free from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
sinful principles, and evil propensities of the human
race. His name shall be called "Immanuel, which,
being interpreted, is, God with us," God in our nature.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
Yes, the uncreated word was "made flesh and dwelt
amongst us and we beheld his glory, the glory as of
the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and
truth." "In him dwelt all the fullness of the Godhead
bodily." The Socinian may smile with contempt
when the Deity of Jesus is attested, but is it not
written? "Behold ye despisers, and wonder and
perish!" Shall not "he that sitteth upon the
circle of the heavens, laugh?&mdash;the Lord shall have
them in utter derision." We would candidly confess,
there are mysteries in this doctrine above the
powers of a finite mind fully to comprehend. But
are we, for that cause, to refuse our belief of its truth?
We should indeed be reduced to a most distressing
dilemma, if we were to disbelieve every thing we
cannot fully comprehend. Who can discover or fully
explain the nature, order, and beauteous economy,
displayed in the animate and inanimate creation?
They are so many problems unsolvable by man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
although by the dint of study, many of the causes
and effects by which we are encircled, have been
traced up to their mighty Author, and eagle-eyed
genius has let in a world of wonders to our view;
yet much, very much, both in the heavens, the earth,
and mighty deep, remains enwrapt in clouds, or thick
darkness. Even in the formation of a blade of
grass, there are operations which man cannot define.
We enjoy the genial rays of heaven's bright luminary,
but who can prove to demonstration, the sources from
whence he has derived such a constant supply of
matter, as to furnish our system of worlds, with light
and heat for nearly six thousand years? In short who
can discover or fully explain the mysterious link which
unites mind to matter? But surely we do not allow
ourselves to disbelieve the reality of their existence,
because we cannot enter into the minuti&#230; of their
nature. If there was nothing revealed, in the New
Testament, of the nature and person of Christ, but
what we could fully comprehend, we should then have
some cause to refuse our assent to its truth, and might
confess it to be a cunningly devised fable. But while
great is the mystery of godliness, remember it is God
manifest in the flesh; not God putting off his Deity to
take the human nature, but it is the second person in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the revealed order of the triune Jehovah, who takes
our nature into union with his divine person, and veils
his Godhead beneath the human flesh. Thus is God
and man united in the person of our glorious Immanuel;
and as if no proof should be wanting of his
Deity, the angel Gabriel when directing Mary to call
his name Jesus, added: "for he shall save his people
from their sins." Thus did he give the most decided
testimony to his Godhead, for who but God, strictly
speaking, can claim a people as his own? and none
but God can save them from their sins. In regard to
the Virgin Mary, we would cheerfully join in Gabriel's
salutation, "Hail! thou highly favoured of the Lord;"
but, at the same time, we would beg to observe a
nice distinction with reference to Mary, who was
only one of Eve's daughters, and, though highly
honoured of the Lord in this particular instance, an
honour which never was or can be conferred on
another; yet Mary's salvation depended on the same
foundation as the rest of God's children, and it is
plain Mary viewed it in the same light, for we hear
her saying, "My soul doth magnify the Lord and my
spirit doth rejoice in God my Saviour." Mary was only
a creature, and consequently it is sinful to offer her adoration,
for it is written "thou shalt worship the Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
thy God, and none other." As to her having any particular
interest at the court of heaven, Jesus has determined
that point, by saying, "Woman what have I to
do with thee, mine hour is not yet come." It is worthy
observation, that whenever Jesus spoke of Mary, he
invariably called her "woman," as if at once to silence
all who he knew would in after ages bestow improper
honours on the virgin. When one said "Behold thy
mother and thy brethren stand without desiring to
speak with thee," Jesus pointed to his disciples, and
said, "behold my mother and my brethren;" and
added, "whosoever shall do the will of my father who
is in heaven, the same is my mother, and sister, and
brother." Whether Mary had, or had not children,
after the birth of Jesus, is to us a matter of no importance;
all it concerns us is to know she had none before.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among
the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall He come forth
unto me, that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth
have been from of old, from everlasting.&mdash;Micah v. 2.</p></blockquote>


<p>We find Boaz (the husband of Ruth) was of
Bethlehem, a small city belonging to the tribe of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Judah, situate about five or six miles from Jerusalem,
and his posterity continued to possess it for some time,
for it was the birth-place of David, the son of Jesse
the Bethlehemite, great grandson to Boaz. This was
the city from which, according to prophecy, the
Messiah should come. If we examine the records
left by the Evangelists, we shall find a decree was
issued by Augustus C&#230;sar, to tax all the people of the
Jews, and every family was ordered to repair to the
cities belonging to their respective tribes. This it was,
which brought the Virgin Mary from Nazareth to
Bethlehem, she being of the house and lineage of
David. It is probable the whole family of David
were cited to assemble for the purpose of being taxed;
it might be with a design to humble and mortify
them, for they had a rightful claim to the throne of
Judah. If this had not been the case, it is more than
probable Mary, from her situation, would have been
permitted to remain at Nazareth. Whatever were
the motives of the civil authorities, we have cause to
bless our God for thus overruling events, which distinctively
considered were oppressive, but now tend
to establish the truth as it is in Jesus. What else,
humanly speaking, could have brought Mary, a female
in the humblest walk of life, to Bethlehem?&mdash;If it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
were not for this circumstance, we should have wanted
this proof of Jesus being the Messiah; for we are
told, he should be born at Bethlehem, a city little
among the thousands of Judah.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Although a manger
was the best accommodation offered for the royal
babe, yet his birth was not altogether unnoticed, or
passed by, as an event of little importance; for lo!
amidst the stillness of the night, an angelic messenger
is sent to announce to Jewish shepherds, the arrival of
the chief Shepherd. No sooner are the glad tidings of
great joy communicated, but a multitude of the heavenly
hosts, who had followed with joyful haste, make
the air re-echo with sounds, sweet as the music of
heaven. While charmed with the delightful melody,
and breathless to catch the strain, we distinctly hear,
"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace,
good-will towards men." The next object which arrests
our attention, is a company of Eastern philosophers,
who are come to pay their adorations to the sovereign
stranger, and to welcome his arrival. But who could
have directed them to this obscure retreat, to find the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
infant King? They were led thither, by a star of
peculiar motion, appointed to direct these eastern
sages (probably Chaldeans), to Israel's King. But
how ill did his appearance accord with the dignity of
his character; yet notwithstanding the poverty with
which he was surrounded, they worshipped him. For
he who was a babe at Bethlehem, by the mysterious
union of the human nature with the divine person, is
the same "whose goings forth have been from of old,
from everlasting." We are told that when he went
forth in the acts of creation, "the morning stars sang
together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy."
What wonder then if they tuned their golden harps
afresh, when he went forth to accomplish redemption's
work, which mystery the angels are represented as
desiring to look into. He is also described as a Ruler
not only in the armies of heaven, and amongst the
inhabitants of earth; but, in a more near and interesting
sense, does he reign and rule in the hearts of
his redeemed. The symbol of his authority is not
an iron rod; no, he rules them with the sceptre of his
love. We would say "Gird on thy sword upon thy
thigh, O thou most mighty; and go forth, conquering
and to conquer; until every land shall own thy power,
and all the nations of the earth shall call the Redeemer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
blessed." May we imitate these eastern sages, and
not feel ashamed to confess our attachment to him,
who once appeared as an infant at Bethlehem; for it
became him, in taking our nature, to assume it from its
earliest state, and in all things to be made like unto
his brethren, sin only excepted.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>Thus saith the Lord, a voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation
and bitter weeping; Rahel weeping for her children
refused to be comforted for her children, because they were
not.&mdash;Jeremiah xxxi. 15.</p></blockquote>


<p>It will not be difficult to discover the mourning prophet
referred to the murder of the infants of Bethlehem,
when it is remembered that Rachel the beloved wife
of Jacob, was the mother of Benjamin, which tribe,
with that of Judah and the family of Levi, after the
revolt of the ten tribes, formed the kingdom of Judah.
We are told the wise men came to Jerusalem, to inquire
from the Jews themselves, at what place their long promised
King should be born; and when told Bethlehem
was the honoured spot, they departed with a charge
from Herod, then king of Judah, to return and bring
him tidings, that he also might go and worship the
infant King. But his hypocrisy was soon discovered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Under pretence, that the wise men had offered him an
insult in not returning to Jerusalem, he issued an order,
to destroy all the children in Bethlehem, from two
years old and under. An order in every point of
view, most cruel, unjust, and cowardly, and which
the most hardened wretch must have shuddered to
execute. The mind cannot conceive an act of greater
barbarity, than the murder of so many innocent babes,
in order to be sure of one, even the holy child Jesus.
It does not appear that any of their parents had offended
the cowardly tyrant, whose heart was harder
than the nether mill-stone. What wonder if the voice
of lamentation and wo was heard, when the murderer's
sword was (to use the prophet's language) made
drunk with blood, with the blood of helpless infants, who
were torn from the arms of those who would gladly
have shed their own blood in the rescue of their babes;
but the armed ruffian band, like their master, were insensible
to pity, and deaf to the cry of mercy. Well
might Rachel, a mother in Israel, have wept, had she
witnessed this cruel order executed on the infants of
her race! How enviable the lot of those youthful
martyrs for the cause of Christ, compared to his,
who, though seated on a throne, trembled at the
name of Jesus, even when an infant at Bethlehem.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the
government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be
called Wonderful, Counsellor, The Mighty God, The Everlasting
Father, The Prince of Peace.&mdash;Isaiah ix. 6, 7.</p></blockquote>


<p>These words, like numerous other passages in the
word of God, are far too sublime to be attached to a
mere creature; at the same time, they certainly express
ideas which cannot be attributed to Deity. "Unto
us a child is born, unto us a son is given," is language
improper to be applied to Godhead, while the
Mighty God, the Everlasting Father, are titles too
Godlike to belong to humanity. In what light are we
to view them, if not as descriptive of the person of the
God-man, Christ Jesus? To whom but the Messiah,
are we to apply this, and the many expressions of a
similar kind, which we find so profusely scattered
through the sacred volume? It is to the wonderful
person of the Messiah, God united to the man Christ
Jesus, that we direct our thoughts, as the glorious
object presented to the faith of the patriarchs and
ancient Israel of God. To him give all the prophets
witness. All the types prefigure him. All the shadows
are designed to represent him, the substance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
He is exhibited to our view in a variety of characters,
relations, and offices; and is not God and man, united
in one complex person, clearly revealed in this prophecy?
Let us apply it to Jesus:&mdash;Unto us a child
is born, unto us a son is given. Behold him! a babe
at Bethlehem, subject to all the wants, weakness and
helplessness connected with a state of infancy and
childhood; such was the holy child Jesus. Unto us
a son is given, who is acknowledged to be of David's
royal line; yet this son of humanity, is also declared
to be the only begotten Son of God, a Son who is the
brightness of his Father's glory, and the express image
of his person. But this Son is not given as a Saviour
to fallen angels, they are passed by, although possessed
of faculties and powers, far superior to the sons of
earth; "God so loved the world as to give his only
begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him, should
not perish, but have everlasting life." Yes, Christ is
the gift of God, and the richest, God could bestow;
he parted with the choicest jewel in the treasury of
heaven; and God has not such another son to give, even
if the redemption of ten thousand worlds required it.
How amazing the love that could prompt even God,
to deliver up such a son; a son, in whom he declared
himself always well pleased; a son whom all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
angels of God are commanded to worship; yet
he was given up to shame, reproach, and sufferings;
yea, his Father became the chief executioner.
"It pleased the Father to bruise him, and put him to
shame." Well might the prophet exclaim, "Wonder
O heaven and be astonished O earth!" Jesus declared
that, as the son of man, all power in heaven
and earth was given to him; and surely the government
ought to be on his shoulders, for who so fit to
manage all, as he who is the Wonderful Counsellor; he
who, from all eternity, knew the plans and counsels of
Jehovah, and with whom he concerted and contrived
the creation and redemption of man; and was it not
between the Father and this Son, that the council of
peace was settled and established, and is it not "a
covenant well ordered in all things<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and sure," and
does not that part of it published to us in the written
word, proclaim it the work of a Wonderful Counsellor?
He indeed is wonderful, both in his person and work:
the wonders of his love are here past finding out; the
wonders of his grace are now unsearchable, and it is
reserved for an eternity to discover all the mysteries
in the Wonderful Person of the God-man, Christ Jesus,
which are here incomprehensible.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>
<p>Are we not told that the child born, the son given, is
the mighty God? which must surely mean, that the
same divine essence dwells in the Father and the Son;
that it is one true and essential Godhead, dwelling
in the person of the Father, Son, and Spirit; not that
they are three Gods, but three distinct persons, constituting
one Godhead?&mdash;(Does not the body and spirit
form one man?) Is not the Son declared equal to
the Father as touching his Godhead? Are not their
names more descriptive of the relations they sustain in
the scheme of Redemption, than indicative of any
superiority or inferiority in their essence, or Godhead?
Is it not the second person in the glorious Trinity, who
has taken the human nature into union with his divine
person? And are not God and man united in the
complex person of Jesus of Nazareth, Israel's long
promised and expected Messiah? His humanity is
fully proved by his birth, life, and death; and his
Deity is fully attested in the strongest language, for to
whom the names, titles, attributes, works and prerogatives
of God are ascribed, and declared to belong,
surely, He must be the true God; and we have only
to search the record of truth, and we shall find ascribed
to him, all the distinguishing names and titles of
God, as:&mdash;</p>

<p>Is not God represented in his word, as highly jealous
of his honour, and has he not solemnly declared,
that he will not give his glory to another? Then, if
Christ is not equal to the Lord of Hosts, whence is it,
that the great God does allow, and sanction, his distinguishing
names, titles, attributes and works, to be
ascribed to Jesus? Can we imagine God to be unmindful
of his own honour, or so unkind to his creatures,
as to permit those names so descriptive of
Deity, to be applied to any mere creature, however
superior, or exalted? Has he not pronounced an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
awful curse on those who worship any but the true
God? Can we suppose the blessed God so inattentive
to the happiness of his creatures, as to suffer in
his revealed word, language so strikingly calculated
to lead men into a belief of the Deity of Jesus, if in
fact he was not God? No, the God of Truth does not
trifle thus with the children of men. He has set all
the great and fundamental doctrines of the gospel in
the fore-ground; all truths that are essential to be
known in order to salvation, are written as with a sunbeam;
the Deity of Jesus, foremost of the whole, is so
plain, "that he who runs may read," and the "wayfaring
man, though a fool, cannot err therein." It
does not require superior intellectual powers or attainments,
to learn that Jesus is the Christ of God; but it
does require art and skill in criticism, to give any other
sense to the word of God. There are persons, who deny
the Godhead of Jesus, and yet acknowledge him a
being of exalted virtue, and a model of perfection,
worthy of imitation. But do they not, in robbing him
of Deity, destroy all his claim to our attention? in
fact do they not make him an impostor and deceiver?
Do they not, with the Jews, raise the cry of blasphemy
against him? and bring him under the curse and
punishment pronounced by the eternal and unchangeable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Jehovah, against every blasphemer? Do we not
hear Jesus saying&mdash;I and my Father are one, the Father
dwelleth in me, and I in him, he that hath seen
me, hath seen the Father also? And did he not demand
all men, to honour the Son, even as they honour
the Father? Did he not declare himself equal to the
Father, and did not the Jews so understand him,
when they took up stones to stone him, because he
being man, made himself equal with God? Yes,
Jesus proclaimed his Godhead; he allowed and encouraged
religious worship to be paid him; in truth,
he claimed all the belief and honours due to Deity.
Surely then, if he is not God, he has forfeited all
claim to our regard and veneration, and appears as a
false prophet and teacher; but the mind shudders at
imputing deception there. Blessed Jesus! may I, with
Thomas, acknowledge thee, from a full conviction of
thy Divinity, to be my Lord and my God. Thou hast
declared thyself to be the Son of God with power, by
thy resurrection from the dead. Hail! thou Wonderful
Counsellor, thou Mighty God, thou Everlasting
Father; thou who didst from eternity engage to be the
Father and head of thy Church; thou who art the
second Adam, the Lord from heaven; thou who
watchest over thy Church with more than fatherly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
care; who suppliest all their wants, healest all their diseases,
and who, in love, dost "chasten every son whom
thou receivest," and wilt at the last great day, present
thyself with them to the Father, saying, "Behold
I and the children whom thou hast given me." Yes,
thou art the everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace;
and who so calculated to make peace between God
and man, as he in whose person they are both united?
He has peace to make between heaven and earth.
He can know and satisfy the honour of God, for he is
God; he can feel the wants and sorrows of man, for he
is "bone of our bone, and flesh of our flesh." When he
entered our world, was there not a proclamation of
peace on earth, and good will to man? Yes, for the
Prince of Peace was come, to make peace and reconciliation,
by the blood of his cross. He is a successful
Peace-maker; he is, in fact, the only Mediator
between God and man; nor is he yet weary of his
office, but ever liveth to make intercession for us.
Hail! thou Prince of Peace. Did not this glorious
Mediator love to manifest himself in that character to
the Church, from the earliest ages of the world? Did
he not honour many of the patriarchs and prophets
with a display of his person? Was it not the Messiah,
who appeared to the Old Testament saints?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Has he not ever been the only visible image of the invisible
God? Are we not told that no man hath seen
the Father, save the only begotten of the Father, who
came down from heaven? Do we not find an opinion
generally prevalent amongst the ancient Jews, that no
man could see the face of God, and live? Moses, and
the assembled multitude at mount Sinai, were of this
opinion. Isaiah exclaimed, "Wo is me, I am undone,
for I have seen the King, the Lord of hosts." Manoah,
Ezekiel, Daniel, Amos, and the other ancient worthies
to whom God appeared, were filled with the
same awful apprehensions. Is it not more than probable,
that God, in the person of the Father, has ever
been invisible to the inhabitants of earth? Would
not the true majesty, and splendour of Godhead be
more than man in his present state could bear? Might
not the sight of unclouded Deity destroy a body of
flesh? Are not all those passages where the great
God is said to appear and converse with his creatures,
more applicable to the God-man, Christ Jesus,
than to the first person of the sacred Trinity? Is it not
more becoming him, who, in after ages, was to take on
him a body of flesh and blood, to appear as man, than
that God the Father, should do so? Were not the
three men who appeared to Abraham in the plains of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Mamre, as he sat at his tent door, in the heat of the
day, this Messiah God-man, attended by two angels;
and were not the two angels sent forward to destroy
Sodom, while the Lord tarried behind to hear the intercession
of Abraham, for that devoted city? Was
not the same glorious personage the man with whom
Jacob wrestled, when he is said to have had power with
God and to have prevailed? Was he not <em>that</em> Angel
of God's presence, who led the children of Israel into
Canaan, of whom God said, "beware of him, and obey
his voice, provoke him not, for he will not pardon
your transgressions; for my name is in him?" Did he
not also appear to Joshua, as Captain of the Lord's
hosts? Did he not in vision appear in the same form
to Ezekiel and Daniel, as he afterwards did to John,
in the Isle of Patmos? And are not all the other
passages, of a similar kind, equally applicable to the
Christ of God? Can we not enter into the prophet's
meaning, and set our seal to the glorious truth, that
"unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given, and
the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his
name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, the
Mighty God, the Everlasting Father, the Prince of
Peace?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set
up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom
shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in
pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for
ever.&mdash;Daniel ii. 44.</p></blockquote>


<p>The book of Daniel contains some very striking
prophecies. The chapter from which this is selected, is
not amongst the least interesting. The interpretation
given by him to the king of Babylon's dream, demands
our particular attention. He speaks of four kingdoms,
as represented by the image.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The first, or head of
gold, is the Chaldean monarchy; which gives way to
that figured by the arms of silver, the kingdoms of
Media and Persia. This is succeeded by the
Grecian, represented by the brass. Then follows the
fourth or iron, which is the Roman power, "in the days
of whose kings, shall the God of heaven set up a
kingdom, which shall never be destroyed," &amp;c. &amp;c.
We will search for proofs of its accomplishment.
Daniel was an Israelitish captive at Babylon, and
when he wrote the first part of his prophetical book,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the kingdom of Chaldea was first in the scale of
nations. In earthly pomp and grandeur it surpassed
all other states. The land of Judea was then in its
possession, and her people, its captives. Its capital,
the mighty Babylon, was, from the solidity of its walls,
the strength of its fortifications, and its gates of brass,
considered impregnable; but, agreeably to scripture
prophecy,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> the city was taken by Cyrus: he entered it
by the channel of the river Euphrates, whose waters
he had directed into another course; and during a
night of riotous festivity, in which the Babylonians
had forgotten to shut their brasen gates, the city was
taken by Cyrus, whom the Lord, at least one hundred
and seventy years before, named as his servant to destroy
the kingdom of Chaldea for their cruel treatment
of his captive Israel. Cyrus, the conqueror of Babylon
(who issued a proclamation for the Jews to return to
their beloved Jerusalem after seventy years captivity)
was heir to the throne of Persia; and succeeded to that
of Media, by virtue of his marriage with the daughter
of Cyaxares (otherwise Darius) his uncle. The kingdoms
of Media and Persia thus united under Cyrus
(after the overthrow of Babylon) obtained the supremacy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
of the world, and preserved that pre-eminence two
hundred and six years, when it was subdued by Alexander,
styled the great, whose dissatisfaction amidst
the shouts of victory, and the dazzling accompaniments
of power, strikingly show the fallacy of seeking true
happiness from sublunary objects. Alexander founded
the Grecian empire, which continued one hundred and
seventy seven years, when it was compelled to submit
to Rome's conquering legions, to whom all nations
bowed, and, by tribute, acknowledged as their superior.
In the days of these kings, did the God of heaven set
up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: yes, in
the reign of Augustus, did the mighty King Jesus first
openly declare and set up his great spiritual kingdom.
Its beginning, to human appearance, was small and unpromising.
Yet, this stone which was cut out without
hands, (i. e.) without human power or worldly policy,
shall become a great mountain, and fill the whole earth.
It is true, the Jewish nation expected the Messiah to
come, surrounded by all the splendours of eastern magnificence;
that he would deliver them from the Roman
power, and, after a reign more glorious than Solomon's,
establish a kingdom which should remain unshaken till
time shall be no more. But, shall the unchangeable
Jehovah alter his purposes or mould his plans, to meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the idle fancies or short-sighted schemes of the children
of men? No, the Messiah has appeared, not in the
style they had anticipated, but in the manner most
agreeable to the mind of infinite Wisdom. Yet,
because he did not assume the gaudy trappings of
earthly state, the Jews reject him, and vainly look for
another, although he appeared at the time predicted.
The Roman power is now laid low, and according to
all their prophecies, the period is passed when he, of
whom Moses and the prophets did write, should appear.
Jesus far exceeds in real excellence, even their own
highly coloured portrait, for the blessings of his reign
extend to ages yet unborn. They expected a temporal
king, but no; the land of Canaan, although the
glory of all lands, was far too insignificant for him to
accept as the sphere of his government. He shall
sway his kingly sceptre, not only over Judea's fruitful
land; but his dominions extend from sea to sea, and
from the river even to the ends of the earth. The
mightiest monarchies are often swept away, as by the
besom of destruction, and all are compelled to submit
to the iron hand of time; yet his, is an everlasting
kingdom, which cannot be moved by the revolutions
of nations, but shall continue firm and unshaken even
amidst the crash of worlds. It was expected the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Messiah would deliver them from the Roman power;
but mark, it was said, his name <em>shall</em> be called Jesus,
for he shall <em>save</em> his people (not from their temporal
oppressor but) from their sins.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Surely it must be
confessed, that earth's greatest conqueror, is far below
him who delivers from the bondage of sin and satan,
which is the worst of slavery. Yes, Jesus saves his
people, the true Israel of God, from the consequences
and power of sin; from the former, by bearing the
punishment himself, and from the latter, by his Spirit
implanted in their hearts. The kingdom shall not be
left to other people, but he will constantly direct and
order all its affairs, and he shall reign and rule for ever.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my
son out of Egypt.&mdash;Hosea xi. 1.</p></blockquote>


<p>We cannot entertain a doubt that this verse alludes
to the call of the children of Israel from Egypt, yet
we are not to suppose it refers exclusively to that
event, but we are to behold it pointing to Israel's Lord.
Christ is said to be the husband of his Church, and
they are both called by the name of Israel;<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> and this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
verse is only one amongst the many instances which
occur in the Old Testament. The patriarch Jacob, or
(as he was surnamed by God) Israel, went with his descendants
into Egypt, for shelter and sustenance in the
days of famine, but they were afterwards cruelly entreated
four hundred years; from which state of oppression
and bondage, the Lord called and delivered them.
In after ages Jesus, God's beloved son, our Israel, was
taken into Egypt, to avoid the persecution of Herod;
and when that tyrant was dead, God called the holy
child Jesus from that land of heathens, by the ministration
of an angel. In Egypt, Israel was first formed
into a church; and thither did the great head of the
Church also go; and the Holy Ghost, by the evangelist
Matthew, has stated, that it was on purpose to
fulfil this prediction. That Jesus was as much the
beloved of the Father, when tabernacling here below,
as when he lay in the Father's bosom, cannot be
doubted;<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> indeed, all the honours of his mediatorial
kingdom, are the fruits of his humiliation and suffering.
We hear him saying, "for this cause doth
my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I
might take it again."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">&nbsp;</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than
milk, they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing
was of sapphire: Their visage is blacker than a coal;
they are not known in the streets: their skin cleaveth to their
bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick.&mdash;Lamentations
iv. 7, 8.</p></blockquote>


<p>In the Old Testament we find a description of the
order of the Nazarites and their laws; we discover a
Nazarite to be one set apart or separated for the Lord,
either for a given time, as in the case of a vow, or for
life, as Sampson, who was a Nazarite from his birth.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
The order was one of Israel's glories; for the Lord
when enumerating some of the many honours conferred
by him on the nation, adds; "and I raised up of
your young men to be Nazarites." They were all so
many types, pointing to the one great Nazarite, even
Jesus; whom it will not be difficult to recognise, under
this description. Jesus is the true Nazarite unto God,
in the eternal council of peace; he was set apart to
accomplish the Lord's great work of redemption.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
Of him it can truly be said, he is purer than snow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
and whiter than milk: he, and he alone, is free from
the least spot or stain of sin: being "holy, harmless,
undefiled, and <em>separate</em> from sinners. The Church
describes her Lord, "as white and ruddy;" as the
"altogether lovely and the chiefest among ten thousand."
Yet when tabernacling here below "his
visage was so marred more than any man's," and his
"form more than the sons of men:" when seen in
our streets he had "no form, comeliness, nor beauty,
that those who saw him should desire him." This
lamentation of the prophet was called forth, by the
state of misery and wretchedness, to which the
Chaldeans had reduced the nation; yet it had a peculiar
reference to him, who in after ages was known by
the name of Jesus of Nazareth. No doubt his having
resided in a town of that name, was <em>one</em> cause of his
having so universally obtained the appellation. We
find it used by the band of armed men when they
came to apprehend him, and by the maid-servant in
the hall; Pilate affixed it to the cross; the devils used it.
It was also used by blind Bartimeus; by the apostles,
both before, and after their Lord's resurrection; by
the angels at the tomb, and by Jesus himself. And by
the power of the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth,
was one lame from his birth made to leap, arise, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
walk.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> We are told the word is derived from Natzar,
which signifies a branch; and is not Jesus described
as the man whose name is "the Branch?" yes, he is
the branch out of Jesse's root, whom the Lord has
made strong for himself.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>The spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord
hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek: he
hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty
to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are
bound; to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the
day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn.&mdash;Isaiah
lxi. 1, 2, 3.</p></blockquote>


<p>This is one of the many descriptions we meet with
of the Messiah, who is represented as being especially
anointed to his office.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> We cannot be at a loss for
a satisfactory proof of the fulfilment of this prophecy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
in the person of Jesus of Nazareth. He did not
come forth unsent or unanointed. When he publicly
entered on the great work of his mission, he was
anointed to the office by the visible outpouring of the
Spirit. We are told, that immediately after his baptism
in the waters of Jordan, the heavens were opened,
and the Spirit of God, as a dove, descended and lighted
upon him; and a voice was heard from heaven,
saying, "this is my beloved Son, in whom I am well
pleased." Thus we hear the Father bearing testimony
to the person of the Son, and we see the Holy Spirit
descending and resting on Jesus. Thus, did the three
persons of the glorious Trinity, at one time, distinctly
manifest themselves, and that at the entrance of Jesus
on his great work. It may be proper to observe that,
as God, he needed not the anointing of the Spirit, for
in him dwelt all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.
It was the human nature of the God-man, Christ
Jesus, that was anointed to the great office of mediator,
which work he had before, by covenant, engaged
to perform. To him, the Spirit was not given in a
limited measure; he is the "Wonderful Counsellor;"
in "him are hid all the treasures of wisdom and
knowledge." It would be a recapitulation of a great
part of the New Testament, to shew the exact method<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
in which this prophecy was fulfilled. When the disciples
of John came to Jesus, to inquire if he really
was the Messiah, he, as one confirmation of the fact,
told them that to the poor he preached the gospel. Yes,
we find Jesus, when on earth, spending a great part of
the three years and a half of his public ministry in
journeying to the towns and villages, publishing the
"glad tidings of great joy," of which angels were once
the honoured messengers, namely, "Glory to God in the
highest, and on earth peace, good will towards men."
The common people, we are told, heard him gladly.
Jesus can, with much propriety and justice, proclaim
"liberty to the captive, and the opening of the prison
to them that are bound;" he can say, with authority,
"deliver him from going down to the pit, I have found
a ransom." Jesus is also King in Zion, whose mourners
he will never fail to comfort; they can celebrate
their Lord's mercies in the language of the Church of
old, "Sing, O heavens, and be joyful, O earth; and
break forth into singing, O mountains; for the Lord
hath comforted his people, and will have mercy upon
his afflicted." We cannot find an instance on record
of any persons who in their trouble fled to Jesus when
on earth, but whatever was the nature of their distress,
he always removed it. We also hear him proclaiming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the "acceptable year of the Lord," saying, Come
now; even to-day, if ye will hear my voice; "now
is the accepted time, now is the day of salvation."
While he proclaims "the year of his redeemed," he
does not neglect to publish "the day of vengeance of
our God." Though he delight in words of mercy and
of comfort, he does not shun to declare the whole
counsel of God. As a faithful monitor, we repeatedly
hear him urging sinners to flee from the wrath to
come, and solemnly warning them of the fearful
punishment awaiting those, who reject the counsel of
God against their own souls.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Nor did he fail to
speak in the strongest language of the miseries which
will be the portion of those, in another world, who, in
this, reject and disobey him. When Jesus read aloud
this prophecy in the Jewish synagogue, and declared
it was that day fulfilled; we are told "all the people
bear him witness, and wondered at the gracious words
that proceeded out of his mouth." Every one who
reads the history of Jesus with a candid mind, must
be constrained to acknowledge that through every part
of his active and eventful life, his conduct manifested,
that the "Spirit of the Lord rested upon him;" that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
his was "the spirit of wisdom and understanding,
the spirit of counsel and of might, the spirit of knowledge
and of the fear of the Lord."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee
in all thy ways. They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest
thou dash thy foot against a stone.&mdash;Psalm xci. 11, 12.</p></blockquote>


<p>The psalm from which this is taken, describes, in
glowing language, the blessed state of those who have
God for their refuge; but we are not to limit the entire
application of these verses to the sons of men. We find
they have a reference to the God-Man, Christ Jesus.
At his first entrance on the great work of his mission,
he was for forty days and nights tempted by Satan,
during which time the devil made use of every
artifice to tempt and destroy him. Amongst other
schemes, he set Jesus on a pinnacle of the temple,
and desired him to prove his Godhead, by casting
himself down from the height; for he said, it was
written that the angels of God had charge concerning
him, and in their hands they were to bear him
up, lest at any time he dash his foot against a stone.
Jesus gave other proof of his Deity than Satan desired:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
he told him he should not tempt the Lord his God,
and he also added "Get thee hence Satan, for it is
written, thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him
only shalt thou serve." It is an undeniable fact that
when Jesus was on earth, the devils knew his person
and publicly acknowledged his Godhead. Yes, angels
and devils own his power; and shall the sons of earth
whom he formed from the dust, be the last to confess
a truth which is acknowledged by all in heaven and
hell&mdash;by the wisest and best created intelligences, and
by the fallen angels, who were expelled the heavenly
mansions, and consigned to the lake of fire and brimstone,
for rebelling against the authority of the great
Mediator between God and man,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> who was, in after
ages, known by the name of Jesus of Nazareth.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations
shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the Lord
of hosts. The glory of this latter house shall be greater than
of the former, saith the Lord of hosts; and in this place will
I give peace, saith the Lord of Hosts.&mdash;Haggai ii. 7, 9.</p></blockquote>


<p>Haggai prophesied at that period of the Church's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
history, when, after the return from the Babylonish
captivity, the Jews built the second temple: on
which occasion, we are told the young men shouted
for joy; but the old men wept,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> for they had seen the
glory of the former house, in comparison with which,
the second was nothing. But the Lord commissioned
Haggai to inform them, for their comfort, that the
glory of the latter house should be greater than of the
former. It appears by the descriptions given us of
the temple built by Solomon, that it surpassed in
grandeur and magnificence all other buildings, which
in any age have appeared to astonish and delight the
world. It has never been equalled, either as it respects
the grandeur of the design, or the richness of
its internal decorations; a great part was overlaid
with pure gold. But these were not the most glorious
distinctions of the former house. It contained the Ark,
with the mercy seat and cherubim;<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> the Urim and
Thummim,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> the spirit of prophecy,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> the holy fire,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> and
the Shechinah, or Divine Presence.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> The Jews
themselves must confess that the second temple was
destitute of these five signs, which so eminently distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the first house. We hear nothing of them
after the Babylonish captivity. Well might the old
men weep, for Ichabod (the glory is departed) might
with much propriety, have been written on the walls
of their newly erected temple. It was afterwards
considerably injured during the wars, but was repaired
and beautified by Herod; yet none, when speaking of
the splendour of the temple, can allow it to bear any
comparison with the one built by Solomon: yet the
Lord hath said, "the glory of the latter house should
be greater than of the former;" and God is not unmindful
of his promises, nor has he ever neglected to
fulfil them. We will therefore endeavour to discover
if this has not been accomplished. We observe, that
the Lord would first "shake all nations; and the
desire of all nations should come;" and then "would
he fill the house with glory." This promise was
made shortly after the return of the Jews from Babylon;
which kingdom had been shaken to its centre, as
were also in succession the kingdoms of Persia and
Greece. The thrones and power of their kings had
been subverted, the nations almost annihilated; and
Rome was the mistress of the world, when Jesus, the
"desire of all nations," appeared. Perhaps it may be
said, that few nations had even heard of the promised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Messiah, and still fewer desired his coming. But do
not the guilty sigh for pardon, the captives for liberty,
the oppressed for a deliverer? does not the debtor need
a surety; the weary and heavy laden rest; the diseased
a physician; the young a guide; the aged a
support; the distressed a comforter; the hungry food;
the thirsty water; the ignorant an instructor; and the
wanderer shelter? That these things are desired by all
people and nations, none can deny; but it is in Christ
alone we can find a supply for all our spiritual wants,
and a remedy for these, and a long list of unmentioned
ills. In Jesus there is a fulness to supply all our need.
He has pardon for the guilty, "liberty for the captive;"
he is the "surety" of the debtor, and the
"physician" of the sin-sick soul; he will be a guide
to youth, and "even to hoar hairs he will be with
them;" he is the "water of life," and the "bread
that cometh down from heaven;" his "flesh is meat
indeed," and his "blood drink indeed:" he will teach
the ignorant wisdom, and "deliver the oppressed;"
he calls to him the "weary and heavy laden,"
promising to "give them rest;" he bids the mourner
be of good comfort, for he will give "the oil of joy for
mourning, and the garment of praise for the spirit of
heaviness;" and truly he is the refuge of the destitute.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
In short, it is only in him, and from him, we can find
supplies for all our spiritual wants; with him is "life,"
"light," "liberty," and "joy." Surely if all nations
did but know him, all nations would love him too; for
he is justly described by the Church as "the altogether
lovely, and the chiefest amongst ten thousand." The
fulfilment of the latter clause of the prophecy, was
literally accomplished when Jesus (the second person
in the revealed order of the Trinity), in our nature,
entered the temple. Surely that must be acknowledged
a far more glorious distinction, than the ten
thousands of gold and silver which ornamented the
former house. Yea, it was a greater honour to have
the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, personally
teaching in the temple, than the five signs which constituted
the greatest glory of the former house. They
were only intended to exhibit to our view a God in
Christ. The temple and its contents were but figures
of the things signified, even the Messiah. The second
temple was honoured not with types, but the person;
not with the shadows of the good things to come, but
the substance, even Jesus, the Son of the most High.
At twelve years of age, Jesus was found in the temple,
in the midst of the Doctors of the Law, both hearing
and asking them questions. Often, in the days of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
flesh, did he visit the temple, and from within its
walls, did he instruct the people, and declare his
divine mission. To those who deny that Jesus was
the Messiah, this promise must for ever remain unfulfilled;
for the second temple never did, either in its
buildings, or decorations, surpass, or even equal the
glory of the former. It is now seventeen hundred years
since the second temple was destroyed, and all its stones
laid level with the dust. Thus are they reduced to the
alternative of representing God as failing to fulfil his
promises; a sentiment, it might be supposed, any man
would shudder to advance, and much less maintain.
To those who receive "the truth as it is in Jesus,"
there appears a beautiful harmony between the
promise, and the accomplishment; they can exclaim,
truly did "the glory of the latter house exceed that of
the former," for it was honoured with the personal
presence of Jesus, the "Christ of God," "the Lord of
life and glory," "the prince of peace." Of whom, it
may be justly observed, that he is the only source from
which true and lasting peace can be expected without
the fear of a disappointment; and this "peace is made
through the blood of his cross."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>And the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his
temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight
in: behold, he shall come saith the Lord of Hosts.&mdash;Mal. iii. 1.</p></blockquote>


<p>The coming of the Messiah was anticipated with
much impatience and pleasure by the Jewish nation,
and particularly about the time Augustus C&#230;sar was
Emperor of Rome, in whose reign, it will be remembered,
Jesus was born. The period according to Daniel's
Prophecy being arrived, the attention of all classes
of the people was so excited by his expected advent,
that when John came, "all men mused in their hearts,
if he were the Christ or not." But he disclaimed all
pretensions to being the Messiah, and pointed to
Jesus as the illustrious person, whose coming had been
so long foretold. We find many instances recorded,
which prove the Jews to have been on the look out for
their long promised deliverer. Aged "Simeon waited
for the consolation of Israel:" it had been revealed to
him, by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death,
before he had "seen the Lord's Christ:" when the
child Jesus was brought into the temple, the aged
prophet took him up in his arms, and exclaimed, with
holy joy, "Lord, now let thy servant depart in peace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
for mine eyes have seen thy salvation &amp;c., &amp;c."
Anna the prophetess, also, "spake of him to all that
looked for redemption in Israel." Frequently during
the life of Jesus do we hear the people exclaim,&mdash;surely
this is "the prophet that was for to come." We find
the Priests and Levites, persons, it must be supposed,
best acquainted with the writings of the Old Testament,
requesting Jesus to tell them plainly, if "he
were the Christ or not." The Lord whom they
"sought, suddenly came to his temple;" yet when "he
came to his own" nation, "they received him not,"
for their minds were darkened by their false notions of
a temporal king. This prophecy loudly proclaims the
Godhead of Jesus, for to ascribe a temple to any but
God is idolatry; a sin most strictly forbidden throughout
every part of the word of God. Jesus is also the
Messenger of the covenant. He publicly proclaimed
the nature of the covenant ratified in the Court of
Heaven, between the persons of the glorious Trinity,
even the covenant of redemption, which is "well
ordered in all things and sure," and was concluded
ere the hills were made, or the mountains brought
forth; when this "earth was without form, and void,
and darkness was upon the face of the deep."<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>Nevertheless, the dimness shall not be such as was in her
vexation, when at first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun,
and the land of Naphtali, and afterward did more grievously
afflict her by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee of
the nations. The people that walked in darkness, have seen a
great light: they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death,
upon them hath the light shined.&mdash;Isaiah ix. 1. 2.</p></blockquote>


<p>From the days of Malachi, the last of the prophets,
until the coming of John the Baptist, a period of
four hundred and thirty-six years, the Church was in a
state of great darkness and apparent desertion. This
prophecy was fulfilled when Jesus resided, or personally
preached in the towns of Galilee; then, "the land
of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way
of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles; the
people which sat in darkness saw a great light; and of
them which sat in the region and shadow of death light
sprung up." Jesus is "the true light, that lighteneth
every man that cometh into the world." He is given to
be "a light to lighten the Gentiles and the glory of his
people Israel." To whom we would say, "Arise, shine,
for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen
upon thee." For through the tender mercy of our
God, Jesus, the day-spring from on high, hath visited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
us, to give light to them that sit in darkness, and in
the shadow of death, and to guide our feet in the way
of peace. "Light and immortality are brought to
light by the gospel" of Jesus, who is himself the
divine fountain, or source from whence must emanate
all spiritual light. He is the light and the life of
man; he came a light into this world, that whosoever
believeth in him should not abide in "darkness."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of
Jerusalem; behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just, and
having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a
colt the foal of an ass.&mdash;Zechariah ix. 9.</p></blockquote>


<p>We have so striking an accomplishment of this
prophecy, that it is scarcely possible to imagine one
can be found, who is unwilling to point to Jesus and
exclaim, Zion behold your King.</p>

<p>Was it ever known that any other king, except
Jesus, made such an humble entry into the city of
Jerusalem, or indeed any city. No, his was altogether
the reverse of such processions. Here was no
herald to proclaim his approach, no charger highly
caparisoned to convey the Monarch, no royal purple or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
glittering attire to distinguish him from the throng, or
dazzle the unthinking crowds. In himself and attendants,
all was, to outward appearance, mean and contemptible.
Yet the minds of this vast multitude,
were for the moment so struck with the truth of his
Messiah-ship, that with one simultaneous shout, they
make the air resound with Hosannas to the Son of
David; "blessed is he that cometh in the name of the
Lord; Hosanna in the highest." This is not the only
instance of their wishing to make him their king.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
His disciples were impressed with the common error,
that he would establish a temporal kingdom. After
his resurrection we hear them saying, "Lord wilt thou
at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?" But no,
his kingdom is not of this world, else would his servants
have been called on to fight for it. The weapons
of their warfare, are "not carnal but spiritual,
and mighty, through God, to pulling down the strong
holds of sin and satan." We do not hear that Jesus
made one visit to the court of monarchy, but many to
the temple. The Roman authorities viewed him with
a jealous eye, and passed sentence on him for avouching
his kingly authority. It is worthy of remark, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the superscription affixed to his cross, instead of declaring
him an usurper, did, in four languages, proclaim
his innocence, and acknowledge his authority&mdash;"Jesus
of Nazareth the King of the Jews." Yes, the meek and
lowly Jesus&mdash;Jehovah has set as king upon his holy
hill of Zion; he is "King of Kings, and Lord of Lords."
He is just, for "behold a King shall reign in righteousness."
He not only has salvation, but he is Jehovah's
salvation, to the ends of the earth. To him
"every knee shall bow, and every tongue confess,"
that "he is Lord, to the glory of God the Father."
It was a striking display of his Godhead, in directing
his disciples where to find the colt, and in overruling
the mind of the owner, to let the animal go only on
their saying, "the Lord hath need of him." Yes, he is
the Lord of the whole earth; "the beasts of the forests
are his, and so are the cattle on a thousand hills."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of
robbers in your eyes? Behold, even I have seen it, saith the
Lord.&mdash;Jeremiah vii. 11.</p></blockquote>


<p>An attentive reader of the New Testament, will
easily discover the correspondence between these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
words, and the circumstance of Jesus driving the
buyers and sellers from the temple; which action
deserves to be carefully considered. It may appear
extraordinary, that persons should have dared to make
the temple of God the seat of commerce, for it was
still used as the high place for offering the daily
sacrifice. But it is probable that, at the first, persons
were allowed to bring for sale, into some of the outer
courts or inclosures of the temple, doves, and those
animals the Jews used for sacrifices; that persons
who resided at a distance, and could not, without
considerable inconvenience, bring their sacrifices with
them to Jerusalem, might always be able to purchase
such animals as they wished to offer.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> In after years,
this privilege was abused, and instead of a sale of
animals exclusively for sacrifice, it became the busy
scene of commerce; and buyers and sellers, merchants
and money-changers, used it as the great mart for
business. Thus a place set apart for the worship of
the Most High God, was made the general rendezvous
of men, whose only aim, was to get money, even
though it were at the expense of their religion. Such
was the disgraceful scene exhibited at the temple in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the days of Jesus, who, indignant at the sight, would
not suffer it to pass unreproved. Having made a
scourge of small cords, he went into the temple, and
drove before him, not only, the herds of cattle, but
the buyers and sellers themselves; and even overthrew
the tables of the money-changers, and poured
out their money. One would imagine the Man who
was able to drive so numerous an assemblage of
persons from their long accustomed (and to many of
them lucrative) seat of trade, must have been supported
by the weight of the civil and military authorities
of the state; but it was quite the contrary: yea,
even the Priests who ought to have been most anxious
to preserve the sanctity of the place, were the first to
oppose this cleansing of the temple. Surely it must
be matter of wonder, how this Man of Nazareth
could, unaided by human power, so easily accomplish
a change fraught with danger and difficulty: but such
was the fact, and there appears but one way to
account for the prompt submission of those buyers and
sellers; which is, that, Jesus being both God and Man
in one person, his Deity was not on this occasion
so much concealed beneath the manhood, but shone
forth with such majestic dignity, that none dared to
resist or dispute his authority. All were awed into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
quiet submission to the command of the God-man
Christ Jesus; when he said, "take these things hence,
and make not my Father's house, an house of merchandise;"
it is written, "my house, shall be called the
house of prayer, but ye have made it a den of thieves."
Not only his acts, but his words, proclaim his Deity.
Jesus can with propriety call God, Father, for he is his
first begotten, well beloved Son, and, as such, he has
rule over his Father's house.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> The disciples who were
observers of the event, struck at the display of his
Godhead, applied to him the words of the psalmist;
"The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up, and the
reproaches of them that reproached thee, are fallen
upon me." If we except the miracle recorded by John,
of the armed men falling to the ground on the reply
of Jesus, this certainly is one of the greatest miracles
he performed in the days of his flesh.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained
strength, because of thine enemies; that thou mightest still
the enemy and avenger.&mdash;Psalm viii. 2.</p></blockquote>


<p>The manner in which this prophecy was fulfilled is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
very interesting. When Jesus drave out the buyers
and sellers from the temple, we are told the children
shouted hosannas to the Son of David. The Chief
Priests and Scribes were filled with indignation to
hear even children confess a truth they wished buried
in eternal silence; and, coming to Jesus, they said,
dost thou not hear what these say? But he mildly
answered, "Yea, have ye never read, Out of the mouth
of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?"
It is more than probable that amongst the persons he
had just expelled from the temple, were the parents of
some of these children; it would not therefore have
excited our astonishment so much, to have found them
mocking and reviling the man of Nazareth, as it does
to hear them shouting hosannas to the Son of David.
There were none of those gay distinctions in the person
of Jesus, which so usually please and delight children;
all was as to outward appearance mean and
unattractive; yet their youthful hearts were filled with
love and admiration for the person of the Man, so
generally treated with contempt; and they as with one
voice shout the praises of this Son of David. Ought
it not for ever to have put to silence the Priests and
Scribes, and all those bitter enemies of Jesus, when he
gave such clear proofs of his being the Messiah, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
even these Jewish children, could discover him to be
the very person their parents, from the first dawn of
reason, had taught them to expect, as the long promised
deliverer of Israel, who should spring from David's
royal line.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>I have preached righteousness in the great congregation; I
have not refrained my lips, O Lord, thou knowest.&mdash;Psalm
xl. 9.</p></blockquote>


<p>It is said, to the immortal honour of Noah, that he
was a preacher of righteousness to the Old World:<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
but as the glory of the latter dispensation far exceeds
that of the former,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> so is its founder greatly distinguished
from all the prophets and teachers under
the Jewish economy. We find Jesus actively engaged
in preaching his own gospel, whenever opportunity
offered, free from the trammels of form, and the
circumscribed rules of human order. We see him in
the temple, and the field; in the synagogue, and on a
mountain; in the crowded street, and the wilderness;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
in the house, and by the sea shore: at one time to
the crowded throng, and then to the little troop of
disciples; now to learned rabbies and rulers, and then
to a few fishermen of Galilee; but in every place and
company he was a preacher of righteousness. He
did not refrain his lips from fear of man. He did not
hesitate to publish doctrines necessary to be known,
because they were of a kind likely to be ungraciously
received. He shunned not to proclaim the whole
truth; whether men would hear, or whether they
would forbear. Again, look at him as a preacher of
righteousness. All he taught was pure and undefiled
as the light of heaven. He did not flatter one vice,
or countenance one folly. He described sin as hateful
to God, whether in the priest or people, the ruler or
the ruled. He taught the Jews, who rested in the
mere letter of the law, that it is of a spiritual nature,
"extending not only to the outward actions," but to
the "thoughts and intents of the heart." He inculcated
obedience, not on the narrow principle of self love, or
to gain the praise of man; but he insisted, that it can
only be acceptable to God when springing from a
principle of love to God and man. He did not instruct
his hearers to keep a fair exterior only, but he went
at once to the seat of iniquity, the human heart; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
declared that the fountain must be first cleansed before
the streams can be made pure. Again, we behold
him as a preacher of righteousness, declaring that
"except our righteousness exceed that of the Scribes
and Pharisees, we cannot enter the kingdom of
heaven." He taught that we must be clothed with a
better righteousness than our tattered rags, ere we can
be allowed to sit down at the "marriage supper of the
Lamb," where all the guests are arrayed in "fine linen,
clean and white," which fine linen is the "righteousness
of the saints." This wedding garment is provided
by the Lord of the feast, and is the spotless robe
of Jesus's perfect and complete righteousness.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter dark
sayings of old.&mdash;Psalm lxxviii. 2.</p></blockquote>


<p>We hear Balaam, the son of Beor, from the heights
of Moab, attended by an idolatrous king and prince,
taking up his parable on the multitudes of Israel. We
also find many of the prophets of the Lord in the different
ages of the Church, presenting their Master's
message in the dress of parable. The sweet singer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
of Israel is here said to open his mouth in a parable,
and utter dark sayings, which have been kept secret
since the foundation of the world. But we are compelled
to pass by this son of Jesse, to direct our attention
to one who may not unaptly be styled 'the
man of parables.' Jesus so frequently used them in
his discourse to the multitude, that it is said "that
without a parable spake he not unto them;" and who
can read his parables without exclaiming, "surely
never man spake like this man." His discourses are
adorned with the striking force and luxuriant imagery
of the East. He made use of the most beautiful
language and elegant ideas, to impress on the mind
a knowledge of things which are not seen and spiritual,
by similies drawn from things which are
seen and temporal. Who can read the affecting
representation of the pity and forgiveness God manifests
towards the ungrateful, rebellious, but afterwards
penitent sinner, so forcibly displayed in the
parable of the Prodigal Son, without being charmed
at the happy simplicity that pervades the whole.
Unlike the productions of men, the words of Jesus,
like the works of creation, display new beauties on
every attentive examination. They lose nothing by
a minute inspection&mdash;they are not mere empty words:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
at every perusal they are increasingly attractive, and we
discover that the most sublime truths are taught, where,
perhaps, at the first reading, we beheld nothing particularly
instructive or engaging.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather
the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and
shall gently lead those that are with young.&mdash;Isaiah xl. 11.</p></blockquote>


<p>The Messiah is here, and in several other parts of
the old Testament, held forth to our view under
the character of a shepherd. He is called, "Jehovah's
shepherd," and to his care is committed the
safeguard of God's flock. He is described as "seeking
out and delivering his sheep from all places
where they have been scattered, in the cloudy and
dark day." He is said to "seek that which was lost,"
and to "bring again that which was driven away;"
"to bind up that which was broken; to strengthen that
which was sick; to gather the lambs with his arms, and
carry them in his bosom;" "to make them lie down
in green pastures, and lead them forth beside the still
waters;" in short, to him are attributed all the kind
offices of a "good shepherd." It will not be difficult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
to recognise Jesus under this description. On examining
the New Testament, we find in it an exact counterpart
of this character. We hear Jesus describe himself
as "the true shepherd," who "calleth his sheep
by name, and leadeth them out, and the sheep follow
him, for they know his voice; but a stranger will
they not follow, for they know not the voice of
strangers;" "he knoweth his sheep, and is known of
them, and they go in and out, and find pasture." His
watchfulness and power are such, that he will not
suffer any, either by surprise or force, to pluck them
out of his hands;<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> nor will he forsake them in the
hour of danger; "he fleeth not, because he is not
an hireling;" and he will eventually collect both the
Gentile and Jewish flocks together, that there may
"be one fold,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> under one shepherd." Nor shall one
of the least of the flock be missing; all "his sheep
must pass again under the hands of him that telleth
them;" even the "good shepherd who has laid down
his life for the sheep;" and now liveth to watch over,
defend, guide, and supply the wants of his flock,
from whom he will withhold no "manner of thing
that is good."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>Certain it is, this "Chief Shepherd" will punish<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
the unfaithful hirelings "who feed themselves, but
not their flocks;" "who have not strengthened the
diseased, healed the sick, neither have bound up that
which was broken, neither brought again that which
was driven away, nor sought that which was lost;
but with force and cruelty have ruled them." Therefore,
O ye shepherds! hear the word of the Lord;
thus saith the Lord God, "Behold I am against the
shepherds, and will require my flock at their hands,
and cause them to cease from feeding the flock;
neither shall they feed themselves any more."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>And shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of
the Lord: and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes,
neither reprove after the hearing of his ears.&mdash;Isaiah xi. 3.</p></blockquote>


<p>The deceptions practised by the human race are
many and various. With no other clue to discover
the real character of individuals than their professions
and conduct, men are often led to form the most
unjust opinions; and frequent and lamentable are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
mistakes that arise. Falsehood often lurks beneath
the warmest professions; the guise of friendship is
made to conceal the perfidious spirit, the mask of sincerity
is worn by the consummate deceiver, and man
becomes the dread and fear of man. Who can look
at Jesus, without being struck at the nice discrimination
of character he discovered in his opinions of
the men by whom he was surrounded. He could
espy in Nathaniel "an Israelite in whom there was
no guile." He discovered that the ardent zeal and
warmth of Peter's attachment would induce him
boldly to suffer death in his Master's cause, although
the denial of that Master loudly proclaimed him a
faithless coward. He could point out the perfidious
Judas, fostered by the eleven disciples as a bosom
friend. He could detect the hypocrisy and deceit
that lay hid beneath the fair profession of the Scribes
and Pharisees; he knew their public conduct was
not in unison with the hidden man of the heart.
He was not blinded by the semblance of virtue;
nothing false passed with him for genuine; he instantly
discovered the counterfeit, however well executed.
Nor did the sterling pass by unknown to him,
though its exterior was defaced and unattractive.
He could look into the inmost recesses of the human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
heart, and discover there the seat of iniquity, he
could behold the monster in his den, however ingeniously
its exterior was adorned by art, and bring to
light the hidden things of darkness. In his opinions
there was no error; in his censures, no unjust severity&mdash;he
always judged righteous judgment; "for he
judged not after the sight of his eyes, neither reproved
after the hearing of his ears." With righteousness
did he "judge the poor, and reprove with
equity for the meek of the earth; righteousness was
the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of
his reins;" and why? "Because my thoughts are
not as your thoughts, neither are my ways as your
ways, saith the Lord of Hosts."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of
the deaf shall be unstopped.&mdash;Isaiah xxxv. 5.</p></blockquote>


<p>Is it not highly proper, that those who profess to be
intrusted with offices of authority, should be able to
exhibit the credentials of their appointment, in order
to be accredited? The prophet Isaiah was commissioned
to proclaim many of the marks by which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Messiah should be distinguished. Amongst other
signs "the eyes of the blind were to be opened, and
the ears of the deaf unstopped." Jesus of Nazareth
not only declared himself to be that long-promised
Messiah, but constantly exhibited, in the most public
and open manner, the credentials of his high official
character, and confirmed his claim to our belief by
his numerous miracles. Could we inquire of Bartimeus,
who, of old, sat by Israel's way-side begging,
who was the skilful oculist that restored to his long
sightless eyeballs the power of vision; joyfully would
he point to Jesus the Son of David, as the gracious
benefactor whose almighty word had again caused
him to behold the gladsome light of day. Might we
hold converse with him who had never beheld the
cheerful face of man, whose eyes had rolled in gloom
and darkness, deprived of the sight of nature's beauteous
works; no doubt he would, with the same undaunted
courage he displayed before the Jewish
Pharisees, declare that Jesus of Nazareth had opened
the eyes of one born blind. Nor were these the only
recipients of his Divine bounty. By his almighty
voice the deaf were made to hear: the 'ephphatha' of
Jesus could "clear the obstructed paths of sound,
and bid new music charm the unfolded ear," for it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
the voice of one whose biddings were enablings.
When the disciples of John came to inquire of Jesus
if he were the illustrious personage so long promised,
or if they were to look for another, we are told, "in
the same hour Jesus cured many of their infirmities
and plagues, and of evil spirits, and unto many that
were blind he gave sight," and requested the disciples
of John "to return, and tell the things which
they had seen and heard;" how that "the blind saw,
the lame walked, the lepers were cleansed, the deaf
heard, the dead were raised, and to the poor the
gospel was preached." To one so well instructed, as we
may presume John to have been in the writings of the
Old Testament, he could not wish for more satisfactory
evidence to prove that Jesus was the Messiah. John
bore witness unto the truth, but Jesus "had greater
witness than that of John, the works which the Father
had given him to finish, the same works which he did,
bore witness of him that the Father had sent him."</p>

<p>That Jesus wrought miracles his enemies could not
deny; but how absurd they should attribute them to
satanic influence. The Devil is not wont to be a
benefactor to our race; we should not expect to find
him lending his power to destroy his own kingdom, or
to benefit the children of men. The miracles of Jesus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
were not an useless display of power, wrought to gratify
idle curiosity, or for sordid or ambitious motives; they
were all designed to promote some honourable or
useful purpose, and were of the most benevolent character,
not unworthy the incarnate Deity whose pity
for his creatures is commensurate with his power.
His miracles were numerous and diversified; they were
wrought openly, and proclaimed publicly; not confined
to one place: Jesus went about healing all
manner of sickness and disease among the people.
The disciples were not the only witnesses to these
extraordinary events. Jesus was surrounded by great
multitudes when he healed the leper. Jairus's daughter
was raised to life in the presence of her friends and the
mourners. The Pharisees beheld the devil cast out of
the dumb man&mdash;the whole congregation in the synagogue
witnessed the instantaneous cure of the withered
hand&mdash;four thousand, and five thousand men not only
beheld the miraculous increase of twelve loaves and a
few small fishes, but their bodies were refreshed by the
plentiful repast. All the people of Gennesaret sent to
collect the diseased, so convinced were they of the wondrous
cures effected by a touch of the hem of his garment.
When in Galilee, great multitudes came unto Jesus,
bringing the lame, blind, dumb, and maimed, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
healed them all. When the poor father's lunatic
son was cured, multitudes witnessed the fact. Jesus
was surrounded by crowds when he gave sight to the
two blind men. The Chief Priest and Scribes saw
the wonderful things he did in the temple&mdash;driving
out the merchants, and healing the lame and blind.
In the synagogue he cast out an unclean spirit. When
the widow of Nain's son was raised from the dead,
much people of the city were with her. The lawyers
and Pharisees watched Jesus when he cured the man
of the dropsy. Many Jews were present when he
called Lazarus from the grave. Jesus was surrounded
by his persecutors when he healed the ear of Malchus.
The enemies of Jesus witnessed his miracles; they
possessed every opportunity that incredulity itself could
desire, of examining the several objects on whom he
had displayed his omnipotent power: this circumstance,
together with the diversity of time and place,
precluded all possibility of deception. Peter boldly
declared to the "men of Judah, and the inhabitants of
Jerusalem," that "Jesus of Nazareth was a man
approved of God among them, by miracles and wonders
and signs which God did by him, in the midst of
them, as they themselves also knew." The intrepid
disciple feared no contradiction, it was a fact too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
clearly established for any of that age to deny; and
what madness is it for any in a later period to cavil
against a truth they possess not a single fact to disprove.
The more minutely the New Testament of
our Lord Jesus Christ is examined, the clearer do its
marks of divine authenticity appear. The exalted
character of the Man of Nazareth requires only to be
known to ensure admiration. Who, that attentively
considers the sketch given of that model of all perfection,
can imagine the history of the Evangelist to be
only a cunningly devised fable? The schools of philosophy,
with all their boasted learning and virtue, could
not conceive any thing half so refined, or so far
exalted above the most elevated of the human race.
From whence, then, did the beloved physician, the
tax-gatherer, and the two fishermen, obtain that beautiful
model of holiness, presented to us in their
writings? They must have copied from life&mdash;they
must have witnessed the living character&mdash;those unlearned
Jews could not have invented so correct a
likeness of incarnate Deity. Even if they had taken
the united virtues of the most eminent saints in the
Old Testament for their pattern, it would not bear a
comparison with the artless grandeur and majestic
simplicity discoverable in this history of the life of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Jesus of Nazareth; which, it should be remembered,
was written at a time when the religion of the Jews
was little more than superstition; for the law of God
was made void by the absurd tradition of the fathers.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
Yet no trait of false Judaism is discoverable in the
character of Christ. In short, the history of the four
evangelists is the very reverse of what might reasonably
be expected from ignorant men, who had strongly
imbibed their nation's bigotry and superstition. The
gospels carry their own evidence, and prove the men
who wrote them not only had the example of Jesus
for their guide, but that they were divinely inspired.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
They have mixed up none of their own corrupt notions
or false ideas, but presented us with a book which is
not unfitting the God of Truth to acknowledge as
his own.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of
the dumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out,
and streams in the desert.&mdash;Isaiah xxxv. 6.</p></blockquote>


<p>Blessed Jesus, we behold thee surrounded by the
diseased and wretched. We see thee attend that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
seat of misery, the pool of Bethesda, whose cloisters
oft resounded the plaintive voice of sorrow; for within
its porches were assembled many of the sons and
daughters of affliction. Amidst the group was one,
who, for thirty-eight long years, had sighed over his
poor enfeebled limbs, and who oft had heard the
joyful sound of Bethesda's agitated waters. But, alas!
this Angel of Mercy brought no healing balm for his
diseased limbs. Oft had he seen a companion in
misery hastily rush into the troubled pool; and beheld
their diseased bodies healed by one plunge into those
sacred waters. Yet his slow, though anxious steps,
never reached its brink, until some happier object had
possessed its healing properties. His case attracted
the kind attention of Jesus, to whom, when questioned,
he tells his tale of wo. But hark! a voice is
heard, "Arise, take up thy bed, and walk." The
astonished cripple no longer needs the friendly crutch,
but treads with ease and joy his gladsome path. Yes,
beneath the porches of Bethesda's pool, the Godhead
of Jesus darts forth its clear and splendid rays. Well
might the fame of this wondrous Physician spread,
and multitudes of the afflicted press to share his
favours. Behold, amidst the numbers who throng his
door, a poor paralytic cripple, borne by four. Every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
effort to force a passage through the dense crowd is
fruitless. Faith does not easily relinquish its subject,
and the roof is even bared to admit this subject of
misery into the immediate presence of the Healer of
diseases. Nor were their efforts unsuccessful. One
word from him does more than the united skill of all
earth's physicians; and he, who, a few moments
before, required a couch to support his palsied frame,
is now seen forcing his passage through the astonished
multitude, triumphantly carrying his own bed. Surely
"it was never so seen before," even "in Israel," that
land so famed for miracles. Jesus not only wrought
miracles himself, but when he sent forth his disciples
to preach the everlasting Gospel, he gave them authority
to work miracles, in order to prove their commission
to be from Heaven. We behold these fishermen
of Galilee, in the name<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> of their divine Lord and
Master, Jesus of Nazareth, healing all manner of
sicknesses, diseases, and infirmities; testifying both
to the friends and enemies of the crucified Jesus, that
God was with them, indeed and of a truth, so
mightily did the word of the Lord prosper. The
blessings of the Messiah's reign are frequently exhibited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
to our view under the simile of water. Jehovah
promises, "when the poor and needy seek water, and
there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst, I
the Lord will hear them, I the God of Israel will
not forsake them; but will open rivers in high places,
and fountains in the midst of the valleys." He will
make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land
springs of water. Rivers of water in a thirsty wild,
are not more acceptable to the fainting traveller, than
the salvation of Jesus is welcome to the convinced
sinner; to such who believe he is precious. The
conditions of obtaining it are inscribed by the finger
of God; we behold them written in legible characters:
"Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters,
and he that hath no money, come ye, buy, and eat;
yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and
without price." Ezekiel, in vision, beheld this holy
water issuing from the temple of God. Its sovereign
efficacy was such, that whithersoever it flowed, healing
and life attended its course. John in the Apocalypse,
describes it as the "pure river of water of life, clear
as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and
of the Lamb;" its banks adorned with continual fruitfulness,
and never-fading verdure. The salvation of
Jesus is also described as a "fountain which is opened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
to the house of David, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
for sin and uncleanness." May <em>we</em> know its
purifying and refreshing qualities: may <em>we</em> drink
deep of the living waters, which are "a well of water
springing up unto everlasting life." Jesus himself
personally invites "all that are athirst, to come unto
him and drink."</p>

<p>This fountain of life, is not of recent discovery;
the antedeluvian world beheld it as a small rivulet,
which continued to increase as it flowed down
the patriarchal age, widened under the Mosaic dispensation,
and became broader and clearer, as it
warbled along the prophetic course, and now displays
itself as the grand and majestic fountain of living
waters, whose streams make glad the city of our God.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is
written of me, I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy
law is within my heart.&mdash;Psalm xl. 7, 8.</p></blockquote>


<p>The psalm from which these words are selected,
was written by David, king of Israel, but never can
they with justice be applied to him. We dare not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
venture to imagine he acted agreeably to the will of
his God, in the matter of Uriah the Hittite; nor was
the law of his God ruling in his heart, when his
pride led him to number the children of Israel. But
let us no longer dwell on the crimes and failings of
this (in one sense of the word) great man; let us
endeavour to discover some other, to whom it can,
with more justice, be applied. But, alas! if we search
to earth's remotest bounds, we cannot find, on this
our globe, one to whom it may be applied without
deserving the charge of flattery. If permitted to
extend our search to the upper and brighter world,
and allowed to inquire of the inhabitants of those
realms of bliss, if they had ever known one of
Adam's race, when sojourning here below, of whom
it could with truth be said, his delight was to do the
will of his God, yea that the law of his God was the
constant ruling principle of his heart;<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> struck at our
want of discernment, they would exclaim with holy
indignation, was He so long an inhabitant of your
world, and do ye not know him? Have ye not read
of his life, of his acts, of his words, and ways;
but above all, have ye not heard the oft told tale of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
his death? Do ye now need to be reminded that the
words are a true description of the man ye call Jesus
of Nazareth? Yes, angels know him, and glory in
their knowledge; with joy would they tell us, that,
with all their opportunities of observing his conduct,
they could never discover in him the least imperfection
or tendency to sin.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Yes, it is Jesus the son of
David, and not David the son of Jesse; who is here
speaking, as other parts of the psalm clearly prove.
He alone could say, without presumption, "I delight
to do thy will, O my God: yea thy law is within my
heart." Jesus came from heaven to earth, to do the
will of his Father who sent him; even to accomplish
the work of redemption, which is as much the will
and pleasure of the Father, as it is the delight of the
Son. His zeal was discoverable at twelve years of
age, when he was found in the temple, and, to the
gentle reproof of Mary, answered, "Wist ye not
that I must be about my Father's business;" which
he preferred before the refreshments of the body; yea,
his meat was to do the will of him that sent him, and
to finish the work. What devotedness marked his
life! days of toil in travelling and preaching were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
often succeeded by whole nights spent in prayer: the
returning sun found him again employed with the
same unwearied diligence in the work he had undertaken.
We should do well to bear in mind, that all
Jesus did was voluntary. There was nothing, but his
love to God and man, which led him to engage in
the work. There was no compulsion, no obligation,
it was entirely an act of his own free will; nor did he
enter on the covenant, ignorant of the difficulties
and sufferings connected with the work. He was
well acquainted with their nature, and extent; he
had counted the cost and weighed the price; and
with a clear view of the immense load of sufferings
before him, did he, with cheerful promptitude, go forth
to the work. We cannot have a more striking exhibition
of his zeal, than in the reply he made to Peter;
Jesus had been warning his disciples of the circumstances
of the death which awaited him; but Peter
could not bear the idea of his beloved Master's
exposing himself to so much suffering, and in the
warmth of his attachment, he exclaimed, "Be it far
from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee:" But
Jesus said unto Peter, "Get thee behind me,
Satan: thou art an offence unto me; for thou savourest
not the things that be of God, but those that be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
of men." Is this the language of the man, who, when
he was reviled, reviled not again, and when persecuted,
he blessed? Can this be the answer of the
meek and lowly Jesus to a beloved follower, who
only spoke with an intention to prevent his Lord
from suffering? Yes, it is; but Peter was little
aware of the momentous consequences connected
with that death. The advice he gave would, if followed,
have been a more dire calamity than the
world had ever known, yea, even worse than the ruin
brought upon our race, when our first parents followed
the counsel of that false reasoner Satan. Jesus, well
aware of the immense benefits resulting from his
expiatory death,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> would not allow even a beloved
disciple to use one argument against his voluntary
sufferings. How different the conduct of Jesus, when
Peter denied him! there was no reproof, no upbraidings;
but all was love and pity for the weeping servant,
to whom, after his resurrection, he gave many kind
tokens of his forgiveness. We are told, when the
time approached that Jesus should be offered up, he
steadfastly set his face to go up to Jerusalem, well
known as the destined place of his sorrows. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
hear him saying, "I have a baptism to be baptized
with, and how am I straitened until it be accomplished."
When Judas was about to betray him,
Jesus said, "what thou doest do quickly." His
delight to do the will of his God, was most conspicuous
when the band of armed men came to apprehend
him, in the garden. He did not attempt to flee,
or endeavour to conceal himself from their pursuit.
He did not shrink from the danger even when so near;
for it is said, Jesus knowing all things that should
come upon him, went forth to meet them; and said,
"whom seek ye," and when told Jesus of Nazareth,
he said, "I am <em>he</em>." There was no evasion, no reluctance,
but he cheerfully and freely delivered himself
into their hands, and met with promptitude the
adversaries he had to encounter. When Peter, indignant
at the insults offered his Master, and anxious
for his rescue, drew his sword in the garden, and
wounded the High Priest's servant, Jesus mildly
reproved him, adding, "the cup which my Father
hath given me, shall I not drink it?" Jesus could
have commanded twelve legions of angels to his
rescue, yet he allowed himself to be bound, scourged,
and crucified as a malefactor. Not all the powers of
earth and hell combined, could have destroyed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
body of Jesus, had he not given himself up a voluntary
sacrifice.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> He had power to lay down his life,
but no man had power to take it from him. The
human nature of Jesus, when united to his divine
person, became in a manner omnipotent: unless he had
freely consented, he could not have been made the
subject of their cruelty, but for that "cause came he
into this world." The active and passive obedience
of Jesus has reflected more honour upon God, than the
unsinning obedience of men and angels could have
done to all eternity. The free and voluntary nature
of that obedience adds a beauty and lustre to the
whole. "Then said I, lo, I come: in the volume of
the book it is written of me." Moses wrote of Christ:
the whole of the Old Testament (if we except some
of the prophetical parts which relate to the then kingdoms
of the earth,) have a reference to the person,
work, or church of Christ. The ceremonies, institutions,
and many of the characters, of the Old
Testament, are shadows, types, and figures of Jesus
the Messiah. Even the preceptive parts are not
exempt. The great apostle of the Gentiles speaking
of the law, says it is a "schoolmaster, to bring us to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Christ." When from comparing our heart and
conduct by the perfect standard of God's law, we
discover our short comings, the law thus becomes a
teacher, and shows us the necessity of an interest in
the salvation of Jesus. He could truly say, "I
delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is
within my heart: How I love thy law, it is my meditation
all the day;" in fact, the law, which is holy,
just, and true, is merely a transcript of his divine
mind.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien
unto my mother's children.&mdash;Psalm lxix. 8.</p></blockquote>


<p>Ah, my Lord, I know this to be thy voice of lamentation,
at the unfeeling conduct of those, from
whom thou oughtest to have received the kindest
attentions. Thou wast as "a stranger unto thy
brethren, and as an alien unto thy mother's children;"
"for even thy brethren, and the house of thy father,
even they dealt treacherously with thee." They cried
"depart hence, and go into Judea, that thy disciples
also may see the works that thou doest, for there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
no man that doest any thing in secret, and he himself
seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these
things, show thyself to the world." "For neither did
his brethren believe in him." No sooner did he show
himself unto the world, and multitudes thronged to
behold his miracles, but they cry, thou art beside
thyself. From his chosen friends, the disciples, he
also experienced much unkindness and ingratitude.
During his unparalleled agony in the Garden, instead
of endeavouring to mitigate, and sooth his sorrows,
they slept, as if careless of his woes. He marked
their conduct, and exclaimed, "What! could ye not
watch with me one hour?" In the time of danger,
"all the disciples forsook him and fled." When in
Pilate's hall, and surrounded by men who thirsted for
his blood, Peter, with oaths and curses, thrice denied
his Lord and Master, who heard, and cast a look of
reproof, mingled with love, towards his faithless disciple.
Blessed Jesus, how few of the tender charities
of life were exercised towards thee, though thy heart,
cast in nature's purest mould, was not insensible to
the kindlier feelings of that nature. Jesus particularly
testified his affection towards John, that beloved
disciple, who laid in his bosom. He also discovered
the tenderness of his regard towards the three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
highly favoured subjects of his friendship at Bethany.
The sight of the sorrowing sisters at the tomb of their
only and dearly beloved brother, his friend Lazarus,
excited the tenderest sympathies of his soul, and drew
tears from the eyes, and groans from the heart of
Jesus. "Behold how he loved him," exclaimed the
by-standers. Let us not think it beneath the dignity
of the eternal Son of God, to have shared in the
sorrows of such a scene; rather let us rejoice, that we
have an High Priest, "who can be touched with the
feeling of our infirmities, and that in all our afflictions
he was afflicted." Was not this event recorded to
encourage us to present all our cares and trials before
him. The cry, "Lord, he whom thou lovest is
sick;" will not, cannot, be unnoticed by him who wept
at the grave of Lazarus; for, though he has changed
his place, he has not changed his nature. As Man,
he can still sympathise with his people in all their
sorrows and afflictions. As God, he is ever able to
extend his all-powerful arm, and give the wished-for
aid.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>They also that seek after my life lay snares for me; and
they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine
deceits all the day long.&mdash;Psalm xxxviii. 12.</p></blockquote>


<p>Where shall we find the person to whom these
words are so applicable, as to Jesus. From the
manger to the cross, he was constantly encircled by
men who were plotting his destruction. If we trace
the line from Herod, the Tetrarch of Galilee, to
Pilate, the Governor of Judea, we find that the enemies
of Jesus were neither few nor weak. We see
marshalled against him, kings, priests, and governors;
Pharisees, Scribes, and Sadducees; the learned
and the wealthy; the noble and the peasant; the
Jewish nation and the Roman soldiery. No scheme
that malice, iniquity, or falsehood could devise or
suggest, was suffered to escape; all were pressed into
their service, and made to bear against him. Every
stratagem was resorted to, that they might entangle
him in his discourse, to form an excuse for seizing his
person. At one time, the Herodians are sent with
the question, "Is it lawful to give tribute to C&#230;sar,
or not?" and though they preface their inquiry with
"Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
no man, for thou regardest not the person of men, but
teachest the way of God in truth," yet he discovered
their hypocrisy; and who but must admire the Godlike
wisdom that sparkles in his bold reply? We next
behold the Pharisees approach with cautious step and
flattering tongue, to ask his opinion of the laws
enacted by Moses for divorcement. On the other side,
the Sadducees appear to present their queries touching
the resurrection of the dead. However artfully their
plans were laid, they could not surprise or deceive
Infinite Wisdom. Their next scheme is to present
before him a woman guilty of adultery, hoping, from
the known kindness of his character, that he would
pronounce her pardon, and then they could accuse him
as a violator of the commands of their great lawgiver,
Moses, who ordered all persons guilty of such offences
to be stoned to death; but he, who knew what was
in man, could foil his adversaries, whilst he pardoned
the trembling penitent. "Let him that is
without sin, first cast a stone at her," sent home to
their conscience, proved the wisdom and Almighty
power of him with whom they were contending. Yet
still his enemies spake against him, and they that laid
wait for his soul, took counsel together.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>For I have heard the slander of many; fear was on every
side; while they took counsel together against me, they
devised to take away my life.&mdash;Psalm xxxi. 13.</p></blockquote>


<p>It is not infrequent that the envious and the profligate
are found speaking in terms of reproach of
characters whose public and domestic conduct are a
beautiful portrait of all that is honourable, amiable,
and truly worthy of commendation. Yet persons will
never be wanting who can truly appreciate and highly
esteem the fair edifice of moral excellence, and bestow
the just tribute of respect it deserves. It is possible
for men to be so far deceived by personal prejudice,
or swayed by the false opinions of others, that they
not only view with indifference, but even treat with
contempt and scorn, persons, to whom the Searcher
of hearts will one day say, "Well done, good and
faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord."
Examples of these facts are not wanting, but we no
where behold so striking an illustration of this truth
as in the reception the Holy Jesus met with from the
men amongst whom he tabernacled. It must be confessed,
that in the most perfect of the human race
there are defects and blemishes, to which even the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
eye of friendship cannot be blind, yet in Jesus there
was a freedom from all evil either in principle or
practice. He could be weighed "in the balance of
the sanctuary," and not found wanting either to God
or man. His actions, when measured by the just
standard of God's law, are pronounced perfect. Yet
he, who was purity itself, was not exempt from slander,
but was called a gluttonous man, and a wine
bibber; a friend of publicans and sinners, an hypocrite,
a man of sedition and strife, a Sabbath breaker,
and a violator of all the laws of Moses. In scorn,
they say, this fellow, and that deceiver, thou art a
Samaritan; a race of men held by the Jews in the
most sovereign contempt and hatred. By some, he
is accused of disloyal and traitorous conduct toward
the rulers of Jewry; others pronounced him guilty
of blasphemy; and, to crown the whole, they declare
him to be a devil; yea, Belzebub, the chief of devils.
Blessed Jesus, thou didst, indeed, hear the slander of
many. Every action was viewed through a false
medium. Thy acts of mercy became an occasion of
offence, and called forth the hatred of these self-deceived
men, and thy whole conduct was vilified
and spoken of in the harshest terms of disapprobation
and scorn. Yet those ancient slanderers and persecutors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
of Jesus, were not without their fears. At
one time, lest, from his growing popularity, the Romans
should take away their place and nation; at
another time, the purity of his doctrine becomes the
source of disquietude. They all secretly dreaded his
power. Fear was on every side, while they took
counsel and devised to take away the life of Jesus.
Pilate's wife could not forbear expressing her fears;
and Pilate himself illy concealed the perturbation of
his troubled conscience. How insufficient was water
to cleanse the polluted hands of that wretched governor,
so deeply stained with the blood of an innocent
victim, sacrificed to his tame compliance; and, to
seal his awful doom, he soon after impiously dared
imbrue his hands in his own blood, and rush uncalled
into the presence of his offended Judge. How tremendous
the situation of Pilate when standing before
the Judge of all the earth, even <em>that</em> Jesus, he had
unjustly condemned and crucified. How different the
scene from that when Jesus appeared as the despised
Nazarene in Pilate's hall. The mind shudders at
contemplating the awful fate of those who dare to
lift their puny arms in rebellion against Zion's King,
and the language of whose hearts till death is, "we
will not have this man to reign over us."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see if
there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto
me, wherewith the Lord hath afflicted me in the days of his
fierce anger.&mdash;Lamentation i. 12.</p></blockquote>


<p>These words are in some degree applicable to the
mournful prophet Jeremiah, but it will do no violence
to consider them as referring to Jesus, and to him they
apply with tenfold force. Let us not pass him by
unnoticed, but let us "behold, and see if there be any
sorrow like unto his sorrow," who, by way of distinction,
is called "the Man of Sorrows." We see Jesus,
attended by three of his disciples, enter the garden of
Gethsemane; we behold him withdraw from them
about a stone's-throw, and, kneeling down, pour out
his soul in prayer to God. Let us draw nigh to witness
the scene, but let us approach with awe and
reverence, for methinks we are about to tread on
hallowed ground. Let the frame of our minds be
solemn and attentive, whilst we view a scene so mysterious
and sublime. We observe Jesus on his knees,
begin to be sore amazed and very heavy: yea, his
soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death; and in
the bitterness of his spirit, we hear him cry out, "Father,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
if thou be willing, remove this cup from me;
nevertheless, not my will, but thine, be done." Being
in an agony, he prays the more earnestly. Thrice we
hear him present the same petition. His agony becomes
so extreme, that he sweats great drops of blood,
and so profusely, that it even falls upon the ground.
Struck at a sight so mysterious and solemn, we turn
towards the disciples for an explanation; but lo, they
are fallen into a deep sleep, although requested by
their Master to watch and pray. Desirous to ascertain
the cause, we survey the wondrous scene, but find no
external marks of punishment. True, the sufferings
of the cross he viewed as near, but they were not yet
commenced; nor can we discover any one afflicting
him. The only visible object we perceive is an angel
from heaven; but his was an errand of love, for he
strengthened him. It is therefore quite clear, that it
was from sorrow of soul, and not pains of body, Jesus
then suffered. We eagerly inquire what powers
could have had such influence over him, as to occasion
so great anguish of spirit? We are told, the powers
of heaven and hell;<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> and we immediately request to
be informed, why the holy, harmless, and undefiled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Jesus, is thus the object of God's displeasure, and the
sport of Satan. We are directed to consult the
records of truth for an explanation of the scene. We
examine, and find that Jesus had voluntarily come
forth, and offered himself as the surety of his people,
having placed himself in their room, and the curses
of the law taken hold upon him, his soul endured
all the horrors of the tremendous load of our guilt
imputed to him. Would you behold the awful consequences
of sin; then go, visit Gethsemane, and see
Jesus prostrate in the garden. Mark the extreme
anguish of his spirit. What language is sufficiently
strong to express the agonies of his soul in that awful
hour, when the conflict of his mind forced through all
the pores of his sacred body a bloody sweat; not
merely a drop or two, but so copiously as to fall upon
the ground, and that in the open air, in a night of
such extreme cold, that, in the crowded hall of the
High Priest's palace, the servants found it necessary
to make a fire to warm themselves. We may well
tremble and stand amazed at a sight so awful and
mysterious as the soul-agonies of the God-Man Christ
Jesus. "Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by?
Behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto his
sorrow, which was done unto him, wherewith the Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
afflicted him in the day of his fierce anger." Yes, the
hand of Jehovah was in it, he then stood up to punish
the sins of his people, in the person of their surety. It
was also the hour and power of darkness, and Satan
then poured forth all his malice, and exerted all his
fury, to worry and destroy this Lamb of God; although
Jesus declared, the prince of this world had nothing
in him, (<em>i. e.</em>) no corrupt principles or evil passions as
materials on which to work; yet was the soul of Jesus
assaulted by all the malicious artifices of hell. It is
more than probable, that the great adversary overpowered
the three disciples with drowsiness, and
caused them to fall into a deep sleep, in order to keep
every source of creature-comfort from Jesus during
this season of conflict and sorrow. In the garden of
Eden, did Satan gain his first triumph over apostate
man; but in Gethsemane's garden, did Jesus, as the
representative and surety of man, give that decisive
overthrow to the power of sin and Satan, which
shook to its centre the throne of that arch-fiend.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which
did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.&mdash;Psalm
xli. 9.</p>

<p>And I said unto them, if ye think good, give me my price;
and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price, thirty
pieces of silver. And the Lord said unto me, cast it unto the
potter: a goodly price that I was prized at of them. And I
took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them to the potter in
the House of the Lord.&mdash;Zechariah xi. 12, 13.</p></blockquote>


<p>Surely every one acquainted with the history of
Jesus, as connected with that of Judas, must acknowledge
these remarkable verses to be prophetical of the
traitorous conduct of that betrayer of Christ. They
describe the base deeds of one of his followers. It
was his own familiar friend, which did eat of his
bread, that lifted up his heel against him. It was not
an open enemy that did him this dishonour; it was
one with whom, for near three years and a half, he
had daily intercourse; during which period he had constant
opportunities of witnessing the miracles of Jesus.
He heard his divine discourses, he saw him display his
power, and, in common with the other disciples, did he
receive the kindest treatment from his Master, to
whose person Judas publicly professed himself faithfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
attached: yea, "he was numbered with the apostles,
and obtained a part in their ministry;" but such was
his hypocrisy, that the disciples were not conscious of
his real character. To his care they intrusted the
slender stock of money&mdash;Judas kept the bag. Though
under the mask of friendship he artfully concealed his
perfidious spirit from the eye of man, yet he could not
deceive his Lord and Master. Jesus well knew,
amongst the twelve whom he had chosen to be his
apostles, one was a devil.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> He knew this serpent,
fostered in his bosom, would betray him. Yet we
behold the meek and lowly Jesus condescending to
wash those feet which were so shortly to run on an
errand of the basest ingratitude. Judas was unmoved
by this act of unparalleled humility; no kindness
could soften his heart, by sin made hard as adamant;
for it appears he instantly arose and, though night (a
time best suited for such deeds of darkness), went to
the Chief Priests, and said unto them, if ye think
good, give me my price; so they weighed him thirty
pieces of silver. For that paltry sum did this perfidious
monster sell his Lord and Master, and engage to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
deliver him into the hands of his bitterest enemies;
and then, to conceal his base and treacherous conduct,
he mingled with his Master's family, and even
dared to partake with them, not only of the paschal
feast, but of the Lord's Supper, which was instituted
immediately after the celebration of the feast of the
passover. So callous was the wretch to every feeling
of remorse and pity, that he could, unmoved and unrelentingly,
even receive from the hands of the innocent
victim of his treachery, the symbols of the Lord's
bruised body, and blood-shedding. When Jesus
mildly declared that one of them would betray him,
the faithful disciples, filled with astonishment and
grief at the bare intimation of such an act of perfidy,
each eagerly exclaimed, "Lord, is it I? is it I?"
The hardened Judas could join in the cry, and with
all the effrontery of a child of satan, appeal for a
confirmation of his innocence; but Jesus knew his
treachery, though hid beneath the garb of friendship.
Alas, wretched Judas! how little didst thou enjoy thy
ill-gotten wealth! Thou hadst scarcely grasped the
price of blood, ere thou didst cast it from thee; before
even the victim of thy treachery was crucified, thou
didst cut short thy race on earth, and madly rush on
the thick bosses of Jehovah's buckler; thou didst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
terminate thy wretched course of sin here, to enter on
thine awful state of everlasting wo. Matthew the
Evangelist informs us that Judas hung himself, but
in the Acts of the Apostles we read, that he fell head-long,
and all his bowels gushed out. These seeming
contradictions are easily reconciled, if we suppose,
which is not improbable, that he fell from the place
whence he hung himself; and thus a double mark of
infamy was affixed to his body. What a remarkable
fulfilment of prophecy, in the purchase of Aceldama,
that potter's field of blood. Indeed, these
verses of Zechariah look more like the descriptions of
a contemporary, than the predictions of one who lived
at least five hundred and eighty years before the events
narrated actually took place.</p>

<p>By the Mosaic law, if a servant was goaded by an
ox, the owner of the ox was to pay the master of that
servant thirty pieces of silver:<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> and for that trifling
sum it was the blessed Jesus was basely sold; he,
whose price is far above rubies, and to whom all the
good things thou canst desire are not to be compared.
But, while we detest the treachery of Judas, let us be
careful that we do not commit the like act. Let us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
not salute Jesus with the kiss of profession, while we
are secretly in league with his worst enemy, sin:
which, of old, nailed Jesus to the cross. No wounds
are considered by him so severe, as those wherewith
he is wounded in the house of his friends.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came
upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.&mdash;Psalm
xxvii. 2.</p></blockquote>


<p>The Psalm from which this verse is selected, was
written by David king of Israel, when under the
teachings of the Holy Spirit. David unquestionably
proved himself a mighty man of valour; and by the
help of his God did he overcome troops of foes;
indeed, as a warrior, he is surpassed by none. But
still these words are not strictly applicable to David;
though he slew many by the sword; yet we never hear
that any of his unwounded enemies fell before him:
and we find but one solitary instance on record, of a
body of armed men falling to the ground, only on a
single word spoken by their adversary. The instance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
to which we allude, was an event which occurred in
the garden of Gethsemane, when a company of men
went to apprehend Jesus. We find a band of Roman
soldiers, armed as for war, (sent by the Chief Priest,)
attended by their officers, and a large concourse of
persons, who were also provided with weapons, lanterns,
and torches, that they might secure Jesus, whom we see
coming forth to meet them, unarmed, and accompanied
only by the disciples. With all the dignity of conscious
innocence, we hear him inquiring whom they
seek; when told, Jesus of Nazareth, he mildly
answered, <em>I am</em>;<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> but instead of instantly seizing
their prey, they go backwards, and fall prostrate on
the ground. Is this the conduct of Roman warriors?
What was it which so soon relaxed the nerves, and
damped the bravery of a soldiery, famed for their discipline
and valour? It was not threats nor menaces;
it was not promises nor bribes; nor was it the sight of
a company more numerous than themselves. It was
none of those causes which usually paralyze the
exertions of soldiers. Surely then there was an
almighty power accompanying the word spoken, for we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
find all this dismay and consternation was occasioned
only at the simple word of Jesus. Then was that
prophecy of Isaiah accomplished, who, when speaking
of the Branch out of Jesse's Root, said, "He should
smite the earth with the Rod of his mouth, and with
the breath of his lips should he slay the wicked."
Truly they had cause for dismay; for they were contending
with none other than the glorious personage,
the Great I <small>AM</small>, who appeared to Moses at the bush;
and the same power which smote them to the earth,
could, if he had pleased, deprive them of life. Surely
this must be acknowledged to be one of the greatest
miracles performed by Jesus in the days of his flesh,
as it was produced by apparently the slightest exertion
of his power.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain
thing? The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers
take counsel together, against the Lord, and against his
anointed.&mdash;Psalm ii. 1, 2.</p></blockquote>


<p>The whole of this Psalm is descriptive of the
Messiah, and we are not destitute of strong proofs to
warrant our applying it to Jesus. We find persons of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
different denominations and rank in society, even kings,
priests, scribes and pharisees, Jews and Gentiles, in
league to persecute and destroy an innocent individual.
Of the Jews we see Caiaphas the High Priest, at the
head of the Sanhedrim, from day to day in consultation
on the best and most effectual methods to secure
and destroy the victim of their displeasure. Of the
Gentile party are Herod and Pilate, deputy kings or
governors under C&#230;sar, assisted by the Roman soldiers,
seconding and consenting to the plans of the Jewish
rulers and people. We see these men forget their
national and personal animosities, to join in the
scheme. Yea Herod and Pilate, although at enmity
before, on this occasion lay aside their resentments,
become friends, and act in unison. But why "do these
heathens rage, and against whom do these kings of
the earth set themselves," and wherefore all this consultation
and contrivance? Is it to secure a powerful
tyrant, the scourge of an oppressed nation? Is it to
subdue an usurper who has arisen to trample on and
overthrow the existing authorities of the state; or is
it to bring to justice a wretch who has violated her
laws, and by his crimes and enormities become the
dread and fear of his race? No&mdash;but it is against the
meek and lowly Jesus, who had never refused to pay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
tribute to whom tribute was due, who had never
attempted to establish a kingdom amongst the princes
of the earth; but when solicited to do so, had ever
checked the proposition, as his kingdom was not of
this world; he could challenge his bitterest enemies
to prove against him any violation of the laws, either
of Moses or C&#230;sar; nor did Jesus attempt to escape
from them, but was daily to be found either in the
temple, or about the city or its suburbs, attended by a
handful of unarmed followers. There is one circumstance
which deserves particular attention, as it tends
to show the extreme warmth and rage of his persecutors.
The night Jesus was apprehended, was the
very night the Jews celebrated the passover: after
which ordinance, the whole of the people were forbidden
to go abroad, or leave their houses until the
morning.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> But so eager were these infuriated people
to accomplish their plans, that in opposition to this
Jewish command, they go out to seize Jesus, whom
they take to the palace of the High Priest, where the
scribes and the elders of the people also assemble, to
contrive measures to get Jesus crucified. It appears
more than probable that they sat in council the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
night, as we leave them late in the evening thus employed,
and very early in the morning we find them
still engaged on the same subject. So soon as it is
day, they lead Jesus to the hall of Pilate. "But why
do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain
thing? Against whom do the kings of the earth set
themselves, and the rulers take counsel together?"
How sad their mistake, if they imagined they were
only planning the destruction of a poor Jewish carpenter's
son, when, in fact, their schemes were against
the Lord, and against his anointed. It was not from
any lack of evidence, that they denied Jesus to be the
Christ of God. The language he used on another
occasion, is strictly applicable to them, and to all those
who do not acknowledge Jesus as the God Messiah.
"Many good works have I showed you from the
Father; for which of those works do you stone me? if
I do not the works of my Father, believe me not; but
if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works,
that ye may know and believe that the Father is in
me, and I in him." The plea of ignorance when the
means of better information are in our power, will only
increase our condemnation. We may all peruse the
Holy Scriptures, which are able to make us wise unto
salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
"all scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is
profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for
instruction in righteousness that the man of God may
be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>False witnesses did rise up: they laid to my charge things
that I knew not.&mdash;Psalm xxxv. 11.</p></blockquote>


<p>Where shall we find one more unjustly accused,
than Jesus. They falsely declare him to be a blasphemer
and seducer of the people. His enemies, in
order to give an appearance of justice to their proceedings,
(for they were determined to destroy him)
proceeded to call witnesses against him; a mock trial
ensues before Caiaphas the High Priest; but, though
the witnesses are perjured, their testimony agrees not
together. They indeed <em>accuse</em> him of having threatened
to destroy their temple and build it again in
three days; but they can <em>prove</em> nothing. It is true,
that Jesus, when speaking of his death and resurrection,
said, destroy <em>this</em> temple, and after three days
I will raise it up again. But this he spake of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
body, of which their temple was a type.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> It was the
honoured spot, in which the Lord met with and
blessed his people, and the body of Jesus was honoured
as the dwelling place or temple of the Lord
of Glory. God did indeed dwell in an house of clay
which, agreeably to his own prediction, was laid low,
even to the ground, and, after three days, he raised
it up again, without human aid or art. These words
are made the subject of their accusation; but, the
charge is so childish and ridiculous, that it deserves
to be treated with contempt. It is a little extraordinary,
that they did not bring against him the prophecy
he had delivered of the utter ruin which, before that
generation should have passed away, he had declared
the Romans would bring upon their devoted city and
temple. But they cautiously refrain from speaking on
that subject, and proceed to accuse him of blasphemy,
but here again they can prove nothing. Caiaphas
artfully enough, adjures the condemned, by the living
God, to tell him plainly, if he were the Christ, the Son
of God. To which question Jesus replies, by boldly
declaring his Godhead,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> and saying, that hereafter they
should see him coming in the clouds of Heaven, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
their Judge. The High Priest then rent his mantle,
and they pronounced him worthy of death. By the
law of Moses, persons guilty of blasphemy, were to
be stoned to death. The Jews being a conquered
people, had not the power to inflict so severe a
punishment, they, therefore, take Jesus before the
Roman Governor, and vehemently accuse him of
perverting the nation, forbidding to give tribute to
C&#230;sar, saying, that, he himself was Christ a King,
and that he stirred up the people, beginning from
Galilee to Jerusalem. But how false and unjust the
accusation. C&#230;sar, throughout his vast dominions,
had not a more honourable or obedient subject, nor
one who by example or precept, better taught the
true interest of the king and nation. He, indeed,
preached from Galilee to Jerusalem, but not with
words of sedition and strife, for he stirred up the people
to practise such a refined and exalted system of
ethics, that those of the far-famed heathen moralists
sink into insignificance and contempt, when their
sentiments are compared with the doctrines of morality
as taught by Jesus and his Apostles.&mdash;"Love your
enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them
that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully
use you and persecute you, and whatsoever ye would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
that men should do unto you, do ye even so to them."
He taught the people throughout all Jewry, to "render
unto C&#230;sar the things that are C&#230;sar's, and unto
God the things that are God's." He even wrought a
miracle to furnish the means of paying his own and
disciples' tribute money. But we cannot find an
instance of his working a miracle to supply his own
necessities, although so poor that he had not where to
lay his head. He ever taught the Jewish nation and
his Apostles, and through them the world, to render
unto all men their due, whether of tribute, custom,
or honour. He enjoined them to submit themselves
to the Powers that be, and, to obey the
laws of their Sovereigns and civil Magistrates so far
as they might be in unison with the commands of
God. Although he spoke so freely of the duties of
the subject, he treated the great ones of the earth as
men accountable to God, for the talents entrusted to
their charge. His Apostles, taught by their divine
Lord and Master, neither flattered the vices, nor
courted the favours of kings or nobles, for they were
no sycophants. Although the doctrine of Jesus was
so pure and Godlike, and his life displayed every
virtue, (for in his spirit there was no guile) and, is the
only one amongst Adam's race, who was free from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
sin, yet against him was the tongue of the slanderer
busy, and calumny dared to raise her voice. Yea
"false witnesses did rise up and lay to his charge
things that he knew not."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man
that openeth not his mouth. Thus, I was as a man that heareth
not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs. Psalm xxxviii.
13, 14.</p></blockquote>


<p>Does not the perusal of these words lead the mind
back to the palace of Caiaphas, and the hall of Pilate,
when Jesus appeared there, surrounded by his blood-thirsty
persecutors, who, in the bitterness of their
malice, vehemently and unjustly accuse him of
crimes his soul abhorred. But, the meek and lowly
Jesus heard their falsehoods with silent composure.
Their calumnies aroused no angry passions in his
spotless soul. Though conscious of the injustice of
their proceedings, he made no remonstrance. Even
Pilate marvelled at his silence, and exclaimed, hearest
thou not how many things these witness against
thee? But Jesus answered not a word. He was "as
a deaf man who heard not, or as one that is dumb so
he opened not his mouth." Yet his silence was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the effect of sullenness, and, though innocent of
crimes alleged against him, he deigned not to vindicate
his character, nor did his noble spirit stoop
to load with reproach even his bitterest enemies.
"Though reviled, he reviled not again; in his mouth
there were no reproofs." Jesus, aware of the situation
in which he stood as the sinner's surety, looked beyond
the bar of Pilate, to the Tribunal of God's
Justice: for though no sin was <em>in</em> him, yet, by imputation,
he was loaded <em>with</em> sin.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Though he was
unjustly condemned to death by the Roman Governor,
he viewed the sentence gone forth against him in the
Court of Heaven, and, seeing the hand of the Lord in
this matter, he was dumb, and opened not his mouth,
"because thou, O God, didst it." This is discovered
in the reply he made to Pilate's imperious question,
"Knowest thou not, that I have power to crucify thee,
and have power to release thee?" Jesus answered,
"thou couldest have no power at all against me, except
it were given thee from above." Although
innocent of the crimes preferred against him, at
Pilate's bar, yet, Jesus knew that he stood charged
before God, with the imputed mass of his people's sins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
for which he had made himself responsible. Is it not
to this, we must attribute the otherwise extraordinary
silence Jesus manifested at the injustice of Pilate's
sentence?</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore, and my
kinsmen stand afar off.&mdash;Psalm xxxviii. 11.</p></blockquote>


<p>How forcible and just the remark of the wisest of
men, "that every man is a friend to him that giveth
gifts." But, in the day of adversity, how few are
treated with kindness and attention by their former acquaintance
and professed friends. At one time we see
five thousand, and at another four thousand persons,
partaking of the bounty of Jesus. Afterwards we
behold a multitude following him; but, he who knew
their motives declared it was "for the sake of the
loaves and fishes." When he was so actively engaged
in healing the sick and diseased, from all parts they
crowd around, and call him Lord and Master; but,
no sooner does the black cloud of adversity lower over
the head of this Benefactor of our race, than the
cringing throng depart; even his immediate disciples,
who had shared his friendship, forsook him, and fled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
at the very first appearance of danger. So precipitate
were they that they stayed not to inquire or consider
if mischief was likely to befal them, by their adherence
to their Master. Only anxious for their own
safety, they leave him alone and unprotected, to struggle
with dangers and difficulties. But one disciple is found
in the hall of Judgment, and even he, with oaths and
curses, denies any knowledge of the despised Nazarene.
But, were none found to espouse his cause?
Did not the recipients of his bounty appear for his
rescue? Were not those tongues whose powers of
articulation Jesus had restored, heard to plead for
mercy? Did not those eyes he had blessed with
vision, with tears supplicate compassion for their benefactor?
Were not those withered arms he had healed,
upraised to shield from insult the giver of their
strength? Did not those he had delivered from the
power of the grave, boldly shed their hearts' blood to
rescue, from the arm of cruelty and oppression, the
restorer of their life? No! Silent as the grave was
every tongue in his defence; no advocate was heard to
plead his cause; no friendly arm was outstretched to
succour or support the oppressed Saviour; "Lover and
friends stood aloof from his sore, and his kinsmen
stood afar off."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XL.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that
plucked off the hair; I hid not my face from shame and
spitting.&mdash;Isaiah l. 6.</p></blockquote>


<p>For the fulfilment of this prophecy, we have only
to go back to the hall Pr&#230;torium, where we behold
the blessed Jesus surrounded by a band of Roman
soldiers, who treat him with every species of indignity.
Not content with having scourged him, (a punishment
considered too ignoble to be inflicted on a free
born Roman)<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> they proceed to insult his Kingly
Office. The purple robe, the reedy sceptre, the
crown of thorns, the bended knee, and the salutation,
"Hail, King of the Jews," are all used in mockery.
What cruelty, mixed with insult, was here; had sport
only been intended, a crown of reeds had sufficed.
But no, it must be a crown of thorns, and that not
gently placed on his head, but its sharp points were
forcibly struck in. His Prophetical Office is next
profaned, by blindfolding and smiting him on the
face, crying, prophesy who it was that smote thee.
They even dare to spit in his face, which by every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
people is considered the greatest indignity that can
be offered, but especially so by the Jewish nation,
amongst whom, if a father did but spit in his daughter's
face, she was treated as unclean seven days.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
The Romans were accustomed to present a civic
crown, composed of oak leaves, to him who had saved
the life of a fellow citizen, but when Jesus literally
laid down his life to save from everlasting death a
countless multitude, whom no man can number, of
the citizens of earth, no such civic honours were
awarded him. When our first parents apostatized
from God, the earth was cursed for their sake, and
made to bring forth briars and thorns, but Jesus
only, of Adam's race, was ever crowned with thorns.
What a spectacle for the angels of light to witness!
The God of glory insulted and mocked by worms of
the earth! To behold that sacred face, before which
they were wont to bow with adoration and love, covered
with shame and spitting. But the season of
sorrow and of suffering is now past, and Jesus, the Son
of the Most High, is receiving the just reward of his
sufferings and humiliation.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> That head, torn and
lacerated by the rugged thorn, is now adorned with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
many crowns, and that face, once obscured by shame
and spitting, now shines with refulgent brightness.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER XLI.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and
acquainted with grief; and we hid, as it were, our faces from
him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.&mdash;Isaiah
liii. 3.</p>

<p>Thus saith the Lord, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy
One, to him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nation
abhorreth, to a servant of rulers, Kings shall see and arise,
princes also shall worship, because of the Lord that is faithful,
and the Holy One of Israel, and he shall choose thee.&mdash;Isaiah
xlix. 7.</p></blockquote>


<p>Here again, we are called upon, to behold Jesus,
exposed to shame, reproach, and sorrow. "He was
in the world, and the world was made by him, yet the
world knew him not." "He came unto his own, and
his own received him not." Though his visit was
an errand of mercy, yet he was treated as the offscouring
of all things. "He was despised and rejected
of men, himself a man of sorrows, and acquainted with
grief; and we hid, as it were, our faces from him; he
was despised, and we esteemed him not." "Away
with him; crucify him," was the public cry. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
to Pilate's question, whether of the twain will ye
that I release unto you, Barabbas or Jesus? they
all, as with one voice, instantly exclaim, "not this
man, but Barabbas." Thus, he who had been cast
into prison for sedition and murder, was released, and
Jesus rejected. Yet it was "Jehovah's Holy One, the
Redeemer of Israel, the Mighty God of Jacob, whom
man despised, whom the nation abhorred, who was as
a servant to Rulers." We may shudder at the indignities
offered to the Son of God when he tabernacled
on earth, and the thought may cross the mind, had I
been present, I would not have joined in opposing and
insulting the meek and lowly Jesus. Good, my friend,
but allow me affectionately to remind you, that if you
are still at enmity to God by wicked works; if you
have not submitted your heart unreservedly to the
Lord, nor accepted his free offers of pardon and reconciliation,
through the blood and righteousness of
Jesus; if you are not simply resting by faith on the
vicarious sacrifice of Christ, as the only propitiation
for sin, and trusting solely to his perfect, yet imputed,
righteousness, as the ground of your acceptance with
God, you are, to all intents and purposes, acting the
like part, or even worse, than did the ancient rejecters
of Jesus, for you despise and reject the Redeemer of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Israel, amidst the full blaze of gospel light. "If
he that despised Moses' law, died without mercy, of
how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be
thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son
of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant,
wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath
done despite unto the Spirit of grace?" We know
him that hath said, "Vengeance belongeth unto me;
I will recompense, saith the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>But let us not forsake our own mercies, nor longer
despise and reject the Christ of God, nor lightly
esteem that salvation, to purchase which, he was
content to suffer ignominy and sorrow. Let us bow
with humility and reverence "before the Redeemer
of Israel." Let us bend the willing knee in adoration
and gratitude before Jehovah's Holy One, of
whom thus saith the Lord, "Kings shall see and
arise; Princes also shall worship before him; the
Gentiles shall come to his light, and Kings to the
brightness of his rising." "Nations, the learned
and the rude," shall bow before the Mighty One of
Jacob, fall prostrate to his all conquering grace, and
call the Redeemer blessed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLII.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and
despised of the people.&mdash;Psalm xxii. 6.</p></blockquote>


<p>Do we not here instantly recognise the language
of the despised Nazarene? And is not the whole
Psalm a striking description of his unparalleled sufferings,
of his unprecedented degradation and humility?
He whose will formed the universal law of nature;
he who marshalled the stars, and called them all by
name; who bid the planets roll, and the sun to
shine; who gave the orb of day his splendid rays,
and lent the moon her silvery light; he whose word
the congregated waters of the ocean felt and owned,
when he said, "hitherto shalt thou come, but no
further, and here shall thy proud waves be stayed"&mdash;he
who shared the throne of Deity,<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> and received the
adorations of glorified saints, of Cherubim and Seraphim,
and before whose footstool even Gabriel
bowed and worshipped.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> He whose right it was to
reign in Heaven, condescended to visit this, his
distant kingdom, and tabernacle here for a season in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the garb of humanity. Surely, if the Lord of Heaven
and Earth deigned, for great and wise purposes, to
enter this lower world, it was undoubtedly his just
right to have appeared in all the majesty and splendour
becoming his rank, and thus to have displayed
himself as the glorious God. Was it not a condescension
in the second person of the glorious Trinity
to assume the character and office of Mediator? But,
how unspeakably great his condescension in taking
our nature into union with his Divine Person, even
if it had always retained the splendours exhibited to
the three disciples on the mount of transfiguration.
Is there not just reason to believe the human nature
to which Deity was united, as far exceeded in its
native powers and faculties the rest of mankind<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>;
as that the intellectual powers of the justly celebrated
Newton exceeded the mental capacities of an
idiot? We behold the God-man, Christ Jesus, voluntarily
waiving his just claim to glory, and appearing,
as the Prophet described, "without form or comeliness;"
for in the eyes of those who saw him "there
was no beauty that they should desire him." He was
exposed to every species of scorn and contempt, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
name a reproach, himself an outcast, the sport and
ridicule of the Jewish nation. We discover Jesus, as
the surety of man, cheerfully lay aside for a season
all his visible and personal glory<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>, to recompense the
injury God's manifested glory had sustained by the
creature's sin. And as Adam the creature, sinned in
aspiring to be as God<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>, so Christ, the Son of God,
in making restitution, condescended to assume the
creature. The satisfaction of Jesus did not consist
merely in his obedience and sufferings, but also in his
abasement and humiliation. He emptied himself, as
it were, of all personal glory<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> to honour God, who,
in the person of God the Father, covenanted to maintain
and demand the honour and dignity due to Godhead.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
The apostasy and disobedience of man had
reflected dishonour on God, therefore Jesus submitted
to shame and reproach, and to have his personal glory
debased to make reparation. The lower he humbled
himself, the greater honour did he reflect upon God,
and the greater was the display of his love to man.
When we consider the character of him with whom it
is no "robbery to be equal with God," and contrast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the true dignity of his person, with his appearance
and reception on earth, we are overwhelmed at the
extent of his zeal for his Father's honour, and his
love for the fallen race of Adam, which prompted him
to descend from the heights of glory and blessedness
to take the lowest rank, and most humbled situation<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>,
in society, to raise and exalt his enemies to a participation
and share in the glories of his Heavenly
Kingdom. Surely "this was compassion like a God."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER XLIII.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not
his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a
sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth.&mdash;Isaiah
liii. 7.</p></blockquote>


<p>It is scarcely possible not to see that it is Jesus
who is here held forth to our view. Who so oppressed
and afflicted as he? Who so patient under insult
and tyrannical cruelty? Who so silent under the
voice of calumny? What lamb so patient under
the hand of the destroyer? He did not resist,
he did not oppose; yea, he did not even attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
to vindicate his conduct; but, with meekness, gentleness,
and cheerfulness did he hear, bear, and suffer,
all that malice could devise, or cruelty inflict. Although
he bore their unjust treatment without murmuring,
yet his was not the tame submission of one
insensible of wrong, or incapable of resistance.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>Under the law, the lamb intended as a sacrifice
was first taken to the door of the tabernacle, that the
priest might have any opportunity to discover if it
was free from blemish;<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> and Jesus the Lamb of God
was not offered as a sacrifice without being first
brought bound before the High Priest. But he,
blinded by prejudice and passion, neglected to perform
this part of his office. Yet this spotless lamb
was not led forth for slaughter, before his purity had
been attested; and, though the Priest refused to do
it, Herod and Pilate gave their testimony to the
fact, that in him they could find no fault. He was
perfectly free from spot or blemish. He alone is the
Lamb whose sacrifice can benefit either Jew or Gentile.
It would be easy to shew, that all other sacrifices
were but typical of this Lamb, viewed as slain
from the foundation of the world; but, as it is more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
connected with type than prophecy, it would be improper
here.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER XLIV.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who
shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the
land of the living, for the transgression of my people was he
stricken.&mdash;Isaiah liii. 8.</p></blockquote>


<p>Here the Prophet presents us with another sketch,
which so exactly corresponds with many features in
the sufferings of Jesus, that we cannot well mistake,
if we consider him as the person intended. What
supinness do we behold in the cause of truth, how
faint are the exertions to promote the Glory of God,
to whom are we indebted for all spiritual and temporal
blessings. Surely, the disciples of Christ, in every
age, must blush to compare their want of zeal for
their Master's Glory, with the ardour and unwearied
perseverance displayed by the adversaries of the
Lord. What exertion and determination of purpose,
is discoverable in the persecutors of Jesus. If they
cannot accomplish their object in one way, they attempt
it in another. If Annas or Caiaphas have not
the power (Judea being under the Roman yoke) to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
execute Jesus, his enemies, nothing daunted, try
Pilate and Herod, from whose tribunal, the innocent
sufferer is again conveyed back to the Judgment
Hall of Pilate, and eventually to Calvary. Thus
was the blessed Jesus led bound by his insulting
persecutors, from place to place, and compelled to
walk many a wearisome mile, surrounded by an incensed
rabble, who thirsted for his blood. He was,
indeed, taken from prison and from judgment, but,
who shall declare his generation. We may trace his
journeys and count the number of his years on earth;
but, we cannot name the period of time, when he first
began his existence; for he existed as God, from
everlasting to everlasting.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> We hear the Jews saying
"As for this fellow, we know not whence he is."
As man, we see him cut off out of the land of the
living. And the Prophets and Apostles, all join in
stating, that it was "for the transgressions of his
people, he was stricken." They again and again
repeat the same sentiment. We are not left with a
solitary proof or two, on a subject of so much importance;
but it is written as with a sunbeam, throughout
the whole canon of scripture. We should never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
view the sufferings of Jesus, but in connexion with
the precious truth, that it was "for the transgression
of his people he was stricken."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER XLV.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>For dogs have compassed me; the assembly of the wicked
have enclosed me; they have pierced my hands and my feet.&mdash;Psalm
xxii. 16.</p></blockquote>


<p>We cannot with any degree of consistency, apply
these words to David. It is true he was often surrounded
by foes, and encompassed by adversaries;
but, never were his sorrows and sufferings of the kind
here described. By the spirit of Prophecy, he spoke
of the sufferings of Jesus, and to him alone can we
with truth apply these words, or indeed, the whole
Psalm.</p>

<p>We see Jesus surrounded by men, who, for their
ungovernable rage, are not unaptly compared to dogs;
and the assemblies before whom he was brought,
proved by their conduct towards him, that they were
unjust Rulers. What they called the Hall of Judgment,
was, in this case, the seat of injustice and oppression.
On every side, did the assemblies of the
wicked enclose him; yea, they crucified him, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
which act they pierced his hands and his feet. Crucifixion
was not a Jewish punishment, but one used
by the Romans, and they considered it so disgraceful
that it was not allowed to be executed on a Roman,
however heinous his crimes. It was only slaves, and
persons belonging to the conquered territories of the
Roman Government, who were sentenced to a death
alike ignominious,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> painful, and lingering. It was
shameful, as the condemned always suffered naked; it
was extremely painful, for they placed the sufferer on
the cross when on the ground, the feet and outstretched
arms, were then nailed to the wood, which being
upraised, and one end fixed in a hole in the ground,
the sudden jirk occasioned the most excruciating
pains to the whole body. And when we consider
that the nails were driven through the palms of the
hands, and the soles of the feet, the most nervous parts
of the body, the mind sickens at the thought, and is
unwilling to dwell longer on so distressing an object;
humanity sends forth a wish that death may speedily
relieve the sufferer. But, as no wound is inflicted
on any part of the body absolutely necessary to existence,
the unfortunate sufferer often lingers many an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
hour in this extreme agony, before the powers of
nature are exhausted and death closes the scene.</p>

<p>This is but a faint outline of the sufferings of crucifixion,
to which the Priests and Rulers sentenced
the blessed Jesus, whom we see going forth to the place
of execution, carrying his own cross, and fainting beneath
the load. His unfeeling persecutors, fearing, lest
he should expire by the road, and thus disappoint
them in their cruel design, lay hold of a Cyrenian,
named Simon, whom they compel to bear the cross
to Calvary, a spot, rendered sacred to memory by
the sufferings of Jesus, who humbled himself unto
death, even the death of the cross. Yes, he who
could command a legion of angels to his rescue, here
submitted to a painful and ignominious death. Do
we hear the Prophet inquire "Wherefore art thou red
in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that
treadeth the wine-vat?" Jesus replies, I have trodden
the wine-press alone; and of the people there
was none with me; and "I looked and there was none
to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold:
therefore, mine own arm brought salvation."
Whenever we look to the cross of Jesus, we should
eye him as "the surety of his people," as the "just
suffering for the unjust, to bring sinners unto God."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
It was for them he wept, bled, groaned, agonized, and
died. But while Christ crucified is to the "Jews
a stumbling block, and unto the Greeks foolishness,
it is unto them that are called, both Jews and Gentiles,
Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of
God." Jesus, that he might sanctify the people
with his own blood, "suffered without the gate."
"Let us therefore go forth unto him without the
camp, bearing his reproach." Jesus suffered a painful,
shameful, and ignominious death, to deliver his
people from the bitter pains of eternal death. His
crucifixion is the procuring cause of their salvation;
for he died that they might live. Ought we not to
admire and adore the wisdom of our God, who could
cause such invaluable good to spring out of what,
distinctly considered, was an act of such injustice and
cruelty. We see the persecutors of Jesus full of fury
and indignation, executing their cruelties on the innocent
object of their abhorrence. But, at the same
time, we discover, that by their instrumentality, the
designs of God are accomplished. Not that their
crime is in the least degree lessened. No, the hatred,
malice, envy, injustice, rage, and cruelty, was all
their own act and deed, and the sin and guilt, consequent
on the foul transgression, is with justice laid to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
their charge. The moral evil of the act, is in nowise
diminished by the Lord's overruling it to accomplish
his purposes and making it minister to his glory. He
can make "the wrath of man praise him, but the remainder
of that wrath he will restrain."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLVI.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? Why art
thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my
roaring?&mdash;Psalm xxii. 1.</p></blockquote>


<p>If we would know whose language this is, we must
by faith ascend the hill of Calvary; there, taking our
stand at the foot of the cross of Jesus, we hear him
utter the dolorous cry, "My God, my God, why
hast thou forsaken me." We do not find a word of
complaint of the pains and sufferings of his mangled
body escape his lips. They are borne in patient
silence, the cruelties inflicted by the puny arm of flesh,
cannot extort a groan or a murmur from the holy
sufferer. This mournful exclamation, was not occasioned
by the agonies of his body. He was not incapable
of feeling them in their highest extent, (for
his human nature was left to its infirmities, that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
might fully suffer) but he was so entirely swallowed up
with the weight of his Father's wrath; that it overwhelmed
the sense of bodily pain. Here again we
are constrained to eye Jesus in the character of a
surety. He had become a surety for rebel man, and
he truly smarted for it. He felt the awful extent of
the tremendous debt he had engaged to cancel, he
found the wrath of God "as an overwhelming flood,"
as "deep waters in which there was no standing."
At that soul-appalling season, the phials of divine vengeance
were poured out, and he drank of the cup of
trembling from the hand of the Lord; not a sip
merely, but he drank of it to the very dregs. He
felt by bitter experience that God's wrath is a consuming
fire; for by it, his "heart was melted like
wax, in the midst of his body." The sorrows of his
soul, were occasioned by the sins of the world imputed
to, and charged upon, him, and for which he then
endured the wrath of God. Yes, in the six hours
Jesus hung upon the cross, he had to struggle with the
sorrows of death and with the fierce anger of God; he
was forsaken by his Father, and suffered his divine
wrath, which indeed constitutes the tremendous
curse. If the thought should arise in the mind, how
that Infinite Being who is emphatically described<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
as a God of Love, could find in his heart to use such
severity toward him, whom he styles "his only-begotten,
well-beloved Son, he in whom the Father is always
well pleased," it should be remembered, that God sustains
two relations towards Christ; the love of a Father
to him as a Son, and the claim of a Judge toward
him as a surety. Although God never expressed so
much anger toward Christ,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> as when he hung upon
the cross, yet in fact, he was never so well pleased
with him as then.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Yea, he was more pleased with
him, than he had been displeased by all the sins that
creatures have committed or can commit. It is true,
mercy is God's delight, but justice is his sceptre, whereby
he rules, governs, and judges the world. His attribute
of wisdom, gives to both their fullest demonstration
and accomplishment. The plan of reconciliation, the
scheme of redemption, by Jesus; is God's masterpiece:
in which all his attributes meet, and harmonise.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
If we would know the abhorrence God
bears toward sin, then we must look at the cross of
Jesus. There it is God has exhibited the greatest
manifestation of his hatred toward it, by his treatment
of him who became the sinner's surety. The drowning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
of the old world, the destruction of Sodom and
Gomorrah, together with the eternal punishment of
the miserable inhabitants of the bottomless pit; never
can display God's detestation of sin so forcibly, as the
astonishing events which once transpired at Gethsemane
and Calvary. If Jesus could not endure to be
deprived of the light of God's countenance for a few
short hours; then how wretched the state of those
who are banished his presence for ever! Jesus well
knew the blessedness of God's favour; he could bear
with composure, the utmost torments that wanton
cruelty could inflict; but he could not behold in silence,
the angry countenance of his Father, or endure to
be deprived of the refreshing presence of the Lord.
Does not this display the love and compassion of our
Jesus, in a most endearing point of view, when we
behold him voluntarily submitting, not only to corporeal
punishment, but also to the curse and wrath of
God for us, and for our salvation?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLVII.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man
that is my fellow, saith the Lord of hosts: smite the shepherd,
and the sheep shall be scattered; and I will turn mine hand
upon the little ones.&mdash;Zechariah xiii. 7.</p></blockquote>


<p>This verse, at the first reading, may appear involved
in difficulty, but a little attention will enable us to
discover to whom it refers. We hear a solemn call for
a sword to awake. What sword? Surely it can be
none other than the sword of divine justice, which
had so long delayed to execute the punishment due to
the violators of God's righteous law. But against
whom is it directed? Against fallen and rebellious
man? No, but against "my shepherd, and against
the man that is my fellow, saith the Lord of Hosts."
The next interesting question which arises, is, Who is
this Shepherd? We answer, Jesus. In the Old
Testament, the Messiah is often discovered to us, in the
character of a shepherd, and in the New, we find
every description fully realised in the person of Jesus
of Nazareth, who is the true Shepherd of Israel. But
why is the sword called upon to awake against him?
This may require a little history, but is easily answered
from the records of divine truth. Mankind in the
person of Adam their federal head, and since, each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
individual, distinctively, has broken God's righteous
law, not only the decalogue delivered to Moses, but
the law of nature; man owing all to his bountiful
Creator and Preserver, was, in point of common justice,
bound to render to his Lord the tribute of his love
and gratitude. But who, amongst the human race, can
venture to stand forth, and appealing to Omniscience
itself, affirm, that he has "loved the Lord his God,
with all his mind, with all his soul, and with all his
strength; and his neighbour as himself?" No, it is
in vain to endeavour to conceal a truth God has declared
so publicly; that by "the deeds of the law, no
flesh living shall be justified." Man having rendered
himself amenable to God's holy law, stands exposed
to all its awful consequences. But "be astonished,
O heavens, and wonder, O earth," to behold this great,
this good shepherd, stand forth as the voluntary
surety of his flock, engaging to take all their guilt, and
its punishment, upon himself. Thus becoming responsible,
for all their mighty debt, having placed himself
in their law room, the sword of divine justice was
called upon to execute its tremendous punishment,
(the punishment due to the whole flock) on the person
of their surety shepherd.</p>

<p>We would next direct our attention to the words,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
"The man that is my fellow, saith the Lord of Hosts:"
and trace their application to Jesus. For proofs of
his humanity, see him a babe at Bethlehem; view him
labouring in the occupation of a carpenter; trace the
innumerable instances given in the records of the
Evangelists, of his humanity; behold him exposed to
all the infirmities of our nature; see him enduring
hunger, thirst, weariness, reproach, privations, pain,
sorrow, and suffering; yes, as man he wept, groaned,
bled, agonised, and died. As God, behold him giving
sight to the blind, making the deaf to hear, the dumb
to speak, and the lame to walk; cleansing the lepers,
healing the sick, and all by a word or touch; yea,
at his command, the dead again sprang into life, and
devils themselves fled, or cried out for mercy at his
approach. When he issued his mandate, be it observed,
there was no exertion of physical power;
and if he ever used outward means, they were such as
carried conviction to the mind of every beholder, that
the cure was not the effect of their application, but an
exercise of his power, who is truly "fellow to the Lord
of Hosts." All the essential attributes of God belong
to Jesus: mark his omniscience in the instance of
Nathaniel,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> "when thou wast under the fig-tree, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
saw thee." See him exercise his omnipotence at the
lakes of Tiberias and Gennesaret, in the two miraculous
draughts of fish; the one before, the other after
his resurrection. In directing the fish to bring the
piece of money; in walking on the sea: and the
instances also, of his feeding five thousand persons from
five loaves, and seven thousand from four loaves and
a few small fishes, and it would appear that the fragments
left, exceeded the slender stock at the commencement
of the repast. Behold his omnipresence in the
case of Lazarus, whom he declared to be dead although
none brought the tidings. Indeed the instances are
numberless, in which the unprejudiced mind may discover
the deity of Jesus. It was often manifested in
his declaring the thoughts and motives, not only of his
immediate disciples, but of many who, under the guise
of friendship, were secretly endeavouring to draw from
his lips something which might give them a plea for
seizing his person. Yes, Jesus discovered himself to
be the omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent, heart-searching
God. Although his humanity and deity are
so closely united, yet they are easily to be discovered.
See the humanity sleeping, but behold the God arising
and rebuking the tempestuous winds and sea, which
knew his voice and instantly obeyed. Above all, behold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
his body carried from the cross to the sepulchre, after
having paid a debt, which the whole human race,
through the countless ages of eternity, were unable to
discharge: but it was fully cancelled by the man who
is "fellow to the Lord of Hosts," and as such see him
bursting the bars of death asunder, and arising, the
triumphant Conqueror of death, hell, and the grave.</p>

<p>The latter clause of this prophecy was fulfilled,
when Jesus was seized and hurried before his unjust
judges; then the shepherd was smitten, and the sheep
scattered, as those who have no keeper; for all his
disciples forsook him, and fled.</p>

<p>The mighty conflict is now past; for the sword of
divine justice, which had long slumbered, awoke;
and, guided by the arm of Omnipotence, was dipped
in the heart's blood of Israel's chief Shepherd: the
man who is "fellow to the Lord of Hosts."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER XLVIII.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my
vesture.&mdash;Psalm xxii. 18.</p></blockquote>


<p>The circumstances attending the disposal of the
garments of the crucified Jesus, are in themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
trifling and insignificant, but when viewed in connexion
with this prophecy, it is no longer a matter of
little importance. It is equally necessary that the
small, as well as the great and conspicuous parts of
prophecy should be fulfilled; and it is highly satisfactory
to trace, amid the more minute events connected
with the life and death of Jesus, so striking
a correspondence with the Old Testament prophecies
of the Messiah. In fact, if these were wanting, the
whole, as an evidence, would be incomplete. How
satisfactory is it to find, in this instance, the very
raiment of Jesus become a witness for the truth that
he is the Messiah. It was not the disciples, or
friends of Jesus, who parted his garments among
them, and cast lots upon his vesture: but it was the
Roman soldiers, who, ignorant of the Jewish prophecies,
could not be supposed to have divided the
garments among them in that particular way, for the
express purpose of fulfilling this prophecy; which
might have been imagined, had it been the disciples
instead of the soldiers. These men, alike ignorant
and unconcerned about the fulfilment of prophecy,
could not even be anxious to possess the garments of
Jesus from their intrinsic worth; no, it was only the
humble dress of a poor jew: nor were they led to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
attach any particular value to the clothes, from love
to its late wearer, for whom they felt neither affection
or respect. It is probable they were severally desirous
to possess some part of the apparel, that they
might exhibit it as a trophy that they shared in the
destruction of the King of the Jews.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER XLIX.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they
gave me vinegar to drink.&mdash;Psalm lxix. 21.</p></blockquote>


<p>It was not unfrequent that cordials or opiates were
given the unhappy objects sentenced to crucifixion,
to blunt the severity of their agonies, and shorten the
period of their sufferings. But, at the crucifixion
of Jesus, no friendly hand presented the soothing
draught. When faint from loss of blood, and parched
by burning fever occasioned by excessive pain, the
dying sufferer exclaimed "I thirst;" a sponge is
conveyed on a reed to his parched lips; but, alas! it
is absorbed in a liquid too nauseous, even for one in
his famished state, to drink. Unfeeling wretches!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
thus to sport with the sufferings of such a distressed
object; thus to mock the wishes of one in the last
agonies of death!</p>

<p>When the son of Jesse, in the cave of Adullam,
longed, and said, "O that one would give me to
drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, that is by
the gate," three of the mightiest heroes in his valiant
little band broke through the opposing ranks of the
Philistine's army, to fetch the wished-for draught; but
when the Son of God required the refreshment of a
little water; when his tongue, from very thirst, clave
to the roof of his mouth, and his strength was dried up
as a potsherd, he was insulted with a mixture of
vinegar and gall. But little did the thoughtless multitudes
who surrounded the cross of Jesus imagine,
that he was then drinking to the very dregs, the
wormwood, and the gall, of Jehovah's wrath, which
was far more bitter to his soul, than their offensive
present to his taste. He was then redeeming his
church from hell, that black abode of wo, whose
wretched inhabitants are deprived of a drop of water,
to assuage their tormenting thirst: and the horrors of
the crucifixion were greatly augmented by the darkness
that shrouded the scene, when the meridian sun
was enveloped in the gloom of night. Blessed Jesus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
though Lord of all, thou wast treated worse than
earth's meanest slave.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER L.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me
with their teeth.&mdash;Psalm xxxv. 16.</p>

<p>All they that see me, laugh me to scorn; they shoot out the
lip, they shake the head, saying, He trusted on the Lord that
he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted
in him.&mdash;Psalm xxii. 7, 8.</p></blockquote>


<p>This prophecy is so exactly in accordance with the
event, that one could readily believe the royal psalmist
had stood on Calvary's mount, and literally recorded
the insulting taunts and ironical reproaches used by the
despisers of the suffering Jesus. The men, their actions,
and the time, are exactly described, and even their
insulting language noticed, with a minuteness that
precludes a possibility of mistake. This disgraceful
scene occurred at the passover; at that feast, when
Israel was commanded to remember her Lord's mercies,
in delivering her from Egyptian bondage; when
he slew the strength of Egypt's land, even from the
first-born of Pharoah that sat on the throne, to the
first-born of the captive in the dungeon. At that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
solemn festival, did those merciless hypocrites discover
(beneath the cloak of pharisaical sanctity) the rancorous
enmity they cherished in their hearts towards
virtue in its purest, loveliest form. But how void of
every spark of magnanimity must be the wretch who
can sport with the feelings of one writhing in all the
agonies of death. How lost to all the kindlier feelings
of our nature, thus to exult over suffering humanity.
Surely the Chief Priests and scribes strangely forgot
their station and their pride, when they could stoop to
join the railing throng, and mingle their voice of
mockery and insult with the Jewish rabble. How
little did they intend to honour Jesus when they
insultingly exclaimed, "he saved others, himself he
cannot save." But we admit the fact, and glory in
the truth. He indeed had then cured many a dire
disease, and released some from the very jaws of
death: and in those very hours of sorrow, he was
saving "a countless multitude, out of every kindred,
and tongue, and people, and nation," who must
inevitably have perished for ever, had he not been
content to suffer for them. But though he saved
others, himself he would not, yea, he could not, save.
His honour was pledged in the council of peace; he
must fulfil the covenants he had engaged to perform.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
God is not "a man, that he should lie; neither the
son of man, that he should repent:" "hath he said,
and shall he not do it?" or "hath he spoken, and
shall he not make it good?" "Sing, O ye Heavens,
for the Lord hath done it; and shout, ye lower parts
of the earth, for the Lord hath redeemed Jacob and
glorified himself in Israel."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER LI.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>Therefore, will I divide him a portion with the great, and
he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath
poured out his soul unto death; and he was numbered with
the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made
intercession for the transgressors.&mdash;Isaiah liii. 12.</p></blockquote>


<p>To whom but Jesus can we apply this. Do we
not find him reckoned with Barabbas, a traitor and
murderer, and were not two thieves crucified with
him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst?
Thus we behold him numbered with the transgressors,
and bearing the sin of many. All the Prophets,
Evangelists, Apostles, Martyrs, with the Church Militant,
and the Church Triumphant, proclaim, as with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
one voice, his death as the expiatory sacrifice, his
blood as the propitiation for the sins of his Church,
and that he suffered, the just for the unjust, to bring
sinners unto God. He died to redeem a countless
multitude of the children of earth, who, freed from
sin and sorrow, will for ever shout victory, through
the blood of the Lamb. This is the great leading
doctrine of the everlasting Gospel. This is the sum
and substance of the Old and New Testaments.
Thanks be unto God, for having given us line upon line,
and precept upon precept, on this momentous article of
the Christian Faith. We hear the blessed Jesus interceding
for transgressors. Even when on the cross
he was not unmindful of his priestly office, but amid
all his personal sorrows and agonies, he did, as with
his dying breath, send in a petition to the Heavenly
Court, for the pardon of his murderers: "Father,
forgive them; for they know not what they do." This
Great High Priest is now sitting at the right hand
of the throne of the Majesty in the Heavens, where
"He is able to save them to the uttermost who come
unto God by him; seeing he ever liveth to make intercession
for them." The God-man Christ Jesus, is
now exalted to high and distinguished honours, on
account of his humiliation and sufferings, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
voluntarily pouring out his soul unto death.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> He
had power to lay down his life, and power to take it
again, but no man had power to take it from him.
He laid it down of himself. Therefore, God will
"Divide him a portion with the great, and he shall
divide the spoil with the strong." The Man Jesus,
now sits on the throne of Deity, and humanity participates
in all the honours paid to the second Person
in the Glorious Trinity. As he was openly put to
shame on earth, is it not right that he should here also
be publicly rewarded? Satan, who so long had reigned
prince of this world, is now a conquered tyrant, his
empire is weakened, for Jesus has spoiled the principalities
and powers of darkness; and he will for
one thousand years confine this destroyer of our race,
a captive in the bottomless pit.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> In that bright day
of millennial glory, all shall know the Lord, and
every tongue shall call our Emmanuel blessed; and
he shall reign a triumphant King over earth's remotest
bounds.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LII.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>He keepeth all his bones, not one of them is broken.&mdash;Psalm
xxxiv. 20.</p></blockquote>


<p>The soldiers (at the request of the Jews, and the
command of Pilate) go forth to execute their last act
of cruelty on Jesus and his companions, having broken
the legs of the two malefactors, they approach the body of
Jesus, but here they pause, hesitate, retire, and leave
his bones unbroken. Whence this mark of respect,
toward the object of their scorn and abhorrence?
Why did not those voices, which a few hours before
rent the air with cries of "Crucify him, crucify him,"
now urge the soldiers to commit the same act of violence
on the body of the dead, though despised Nazarene.
To what cause must we attribute this act of
forbearance, on the part of the by-standers as well as
soldiers? Surely, to none other than the over-ruling
Providence of God. He who has the hearts of all men
at his disposal, watched over the body of Jesus, and
preserved it from that act of violence, "He kept all
his bones, not one of them was broken." How exactly
was the prophecy fulfilled! How striking a resemblance
does the original bear to the portrait! The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Lamb slain at the Passover, was intended to exhibit
to ancient Israel a crucified Saviour. Of that typical
Lamb, Jehovah expressly commanded, "A bone
should not be broken." Though the whole of the
flesh was to be consumed, yet not a bone was to be
injured.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> Does not that solemn Jewish sacrifice,
point us to Jesus, the "Lamb of God, whose blood
is able to cleanse from all sin;"<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> and applied by the
Spirit, will "purge the conscience from dead works,
to serve the living and true God."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER LIII.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>And they shall look upon me whom they have pierced.&mdash;Zechariah
xii. 10.</p></blockquote>


<p>One of the soldiers, with a spear, pierced the side
of Jesus, and forthwith came thereout blood and
water. "He that saw it bare record, and his record
is true".<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> And we know that he saith true, that ye
might believe, that it is Jesus of whom the scripture
saith, they "Shall look on him whom they have
pierced." There is another and higher use to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
made of this circumstance. Simple as the fact at
first sight may appear, yet it is the strongest proof of
the death of Jesus. If only blood had issued from
the wound, it would prove comparatively little. But,
water was also seen to flow from the side; which
was either the small quantity of water inclosed
in the pericardium, in which the heart swims, or
else the cruor was almost coagulated and separated
from the serum. If it is to be attributed to the
latter cause, it confirms what the evangelist relates;
that Jesus had been some time dead. But, if we
place it to the former, it is utterly impossible Jesus
could have survived the wound, even if given in perfect
health. In either case, it effectually proves his
death. Not a reasonable doubt can remain to suppose
he was taken alive from the cross. May the act of
the soldier, (wanton and cruel as it certainly was,) convince
the infidel, that Jesus was not taken from the cross
before life was quite extinct; and may he be led to look
on him "whom he has pierced, and mourn." Blessed
Jesus, may we often meditate on those awful scenes,
when the rugged thorn pierced thy sacred temples, the
nails thy hands and feet, the spear thy side, and the
wrath of God thy soul. And, while we eye thee as
the just suffering for the unjust, may we learn to abhor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
sin, which is so hateful in the sight of a pure and
Holy God, that the blood of his own well-beloved
Son was shed ere it could be pardoned. Is not
the view of a suffering Redeemer calculated to raise
the Christian's confidence, even in seasons of the
deepest affliction?<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> May he not fearlessly resign his
spiritual and temporal concerns, his fondest hopes and
most anxious cares, to the guidance and wisdom of
him, who so loved him as to die for him? For if,
when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by
the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled,
we shall be saved by his life."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LIV.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth
their covering.&mdash;Isaiah l. 3.</p></blockquote>


<p>Isaiah, or, as he is generally called, the Evangelical
Prophet, (from his writings referring more frequently
to the person and offices of Christ, than those
of the other prophets,) when speaking of his sufferings
declares, that "The heavens shall become black as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
sackcloth of hair." This figurative description was
realised at the crucifixion of Jesus. The sun at
mid-day was eclipsed, darkness covered the land, from
the sixth to the ninth hour, which, by our mode of
computing time, was from twelve to three o'clock in
the afternoon. The Jews begin their day at six
o'clock in the morning. Perhaps it may be thought
superstitious weakness, to imagine an eclipse portended
some great event? We reply, <em>this</em> was not
the result of natural causes. It took place on the day
the Jews killed the Passover, which festival they
were commanded, and always did observe at the full
of the moon;<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> therefore, it is evident, the moon's
shadow could not <em>then</em> fall on the sun, for then they
were in opposition, or one hundred and eighty degrees
apart; besides, a total eclipse of the sun never lasts
ten minutes, yet, this was a total eclipse from the sixth
to the ninth hour, so that darkness covered, at least
the whole land of Judea, for three hours, which is
contrary to the laws given by heaven's great architect,
to these his works. This extraordinary eclipse
is noticed in profane history; Dionysius, at Heliopolis,
in Egypt, said of this darkness, "Aut Deus natur&#230;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
patitur, aut mundi machina dissolvitur."&mdash;Either the
God of nature is suffering, or the machine of the
world tumbling into ruin. It was a supernatural
event, and designed to show, that when Jesus stood
forth as the surety of his people, he felt all the dread
punishment due to them. Man, by his rebellion, has
not only forfeited all spiritual blessings; but to temporal
mercies also he has no claim. When Jesus, as
our Head and Representative, bore the curse due to
our sins, he was deprived of the cheering rays of heaven's
great luminary, which was but a faint resemblance
of the withdrawing of the light of God's countenance.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
Behold the awful effects of sin, although it
was only <em>sin imputed</em> to the Son of God. Yet, the
lamp of day withdraws his shining, as if sickening at
the sight. Unable to behold the astonishing event,
he hides his head, and shrinks back, as if unwilling
to shed his beams over a scene so tremendously awful.
The event might also be designed to show the darkness
of the Mosaic dispensation, which was then
for ever to be done away. It was but a shadow of
good things to come; but light and immortality are
brought to light by the gospel. Jesus, the Son of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Righteousness is arisen, with healing in his wings;
and darkness, and its attendant superstition, shall flee
away as the shadows upon the mountain's brow, on
the appearance of the majesty of day in the rosy east.
As the sun in the natural world is the source of light
and heat, such is Jesus to the spiritual world; he is
the Light of Life, and there is not a ray of hope or
light to cheer the rugged path of sorrow, but what
must emanate from this Fountain of Light; even
amidst seasons of health and prosperity, all is darkness
and gloom within, unless the soul is enlightened
by his all-gladdening beams.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LV.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich
in his death; because he hath done no violence, neither was
any deceit in his mouth.&mdash;Isaiah liii. 9.</p></blockquote>


<p>It is usual, amongst many nations, for the bodies
of those who fall by the hand of the public executioner,
not only to be denied the rites of burial, but
to be exposed to marked contempt. Though Jesus
made his grave with the wicked, yet it was also with
the rich in his death. Crucified at Golgotha amidst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
two thieves, he shall receive an honourable burial.
All the Evangelists have recorded the circumstances
of his interment, and nobly distinguished the name of
Joseph of Arimathea, for the marked respect with
which he treated the body of the despised Nazarene.
Timidity kept him from before publicly acknowledging
his attachment to Jesus; yet it is remarked, though
a member of the Sanhedrim he consented<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> not to the
deed and counsel of those who condemned the Lord
of life and glory. Fully aware of the contempt and
scorn affixed to the followers of the crucified Jesus,
his noble, disinterested spirit now led him resolutely
to face it all; to rescue, if possible, the body from
further abuse and dishonour. He went boldly unto
Pilate, and begged the body. His request is granted,
Pilate having ascertained from the centurion, that
Jesus had been some time dead. Joseph is now
joined by Nicodemus, (who at first came to Jesus by
night,) and these two, high in rank and office, the one
an honourable counsellor, the other a ruler of the
Jews, are busily engaged in paying the last sad tribute
of respect to the remains of their dear departed Lord.
One having provided an hundred pounds weight of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
spices to embalm the body after the custom of the
Jews, and the other supplying the fine linen, they
proceed to deposit the body in the sacred chamber of
the tomb. The receptacle of this mighty dead was
not the royal mausoleum of Judah's kings, but a new
sepulchre, hewn out of a rock, in Joseph of Arimathea's
garden. There laid they Jesus, where never
man before was laid. No funeral pomp or pageantry
of state, that solemn mockery of wo, adorned his
funeral procession. Though its attendants were few,
yet the tears of affection and love bedewed his mangled
body, and the voice of lamentation and sorrow
reverberate through this solemn vault of death. How
was the mighty fallen! That arm, then motionless
in death, ne'er did a deed of violence; that tongue,
whose universal law was kindness, was then silent as
the grave; and that mouth, in which deceit ne'er
found a place, was closed by the iron hand of death.
Behold here "an Israelite indeed, in whose spirit was
no guile." Surely the grave never before contained
such a prisoner. Its triumphs were complete, when
Jesus was brought into the dust of death.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LVI.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered
him with shame. Selah.&mdash;Psalm lxxxix. 45.</p></blockquote>


<p>Blessed Jesus! we behold thee cut off in the prime
of thy days, in the meridian of thy strength, and in
the vigour of manhood. Thy body was not worn by
disease, nor decrepit by age; but thy bones were full
of marrow, and thy bow abode in strength, when,
little more than thirty-three years old, thou didst cheerfully
resign thy body to the cold arms of death! The
periods of the incarnation and crucifixion of Jesus,
are very particularly marked by the sacred historians.
His birth was in the year that Augustus C&#230;sar, Emperor
of Rome, issued his decree for taxing the Jewish
people; after which event, he reigned nearly fifteen
years, and was succeeded by Tiberius, his adopted son.
It was in the fifteenth year of his reign, that Jesus,
who was then about thirty years of age, entered on
his public ministry. By the Mosaic law, none were
allowed to minister in the priest's office, until thirty,
nor after fifty years old.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Jesus was not of the
tribe of Levi, but Judah; yet, as the priesthood centred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
in him, it became him, when fulfilling all righteousness,
to submit to this Jewish command. From
the writings of the Apostle John, we can pretty
clearly determine the public ministry of Jesus to have
been three years and a half, that Evangelist having
marked in the period four Passovers (annual Jewish
festivals); one was celebrated not long after the baptism
of Jesus, and two others are also recorded before the
one at which Jesus was crucified; that memorable
one when "the days of his youth were shortened, and
he was covered with shame." A noble mind is far
more sensible of shame, and feels it more acutely,
than the body can any corporeal punishment, however
severe. Yet Jesus, who possessed true nobility of
spirit, was exposed to shame in all its varied forms.
His companions were unlearned fishermen, publicans,
and sinners; his character was vilified&mdash;he was accused
of vices and crimes of the most odious nature,
and his very name was a stigma of reproach. At
his trial, he endured shameful indignities. The
Jewish nation even preferred having a traitor and
murderer restored to liberty, rather than Jesus. He
was publicly scourged, spit upon, buffeted, and crucified
as a malefactor. The only type of his crucifixion
was the brazen serpent, and amidst all the irrational<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
creation of God, the serpent only is pronounced
accursed.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> The circumstances attending the
crucifixion, were of the most degrading and humiliating
nature. Jesus suffered naked&mdash;his companions
were two thieves. The spot was Golgotha, a place
strewed with the unburied sculls of criminals. Nor
were these things done in a corner, but at Jerusalem,
the chief city of Jewry. The time chosen was the
feast of the Passover, when all the Israelitish males<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
were wont to repair to the royal city, and thus became
spectators of the shame and dishonour cast upon this
despised man of Nazareth, "who for the joy that
was set before him, endured the cross, despised the
shame, and is for ever set down at the right hand of
the Majesty on High."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LVII.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows;
yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.
But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised
for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon
him, and with his stripes we are healed. All we like sheep
have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way;
and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.&mdash;Isaiah
liii. 4, 5, 6.</p></blockquote>


<p>"I pray thee, of whom did the Prophet speak these
words?" was the inquiry of an Eunuch of great authority
under Candace, Queen of the Ethiopians, when
reading this chapter. Philip replied by beginning
at the same scripture, and preaching unto him Jesus.
To him alone can we apply the whole chapter. In
every part it bears so striking a resemblance, that it
appears more like a history written by a contemporary,
than the prediction of a Prophet who lived at least
seven hundred years before the character described.
These verses are more valuable than fine gold&mdash;they
are the key of knowledge&mdash;they open to our view a
work of immense wisdom and benefit&mdash;they make us
acquainted with the counsel and plans of Jehovah.&mdash;By
them, a circumstance in the moral government of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
God, which was before dark and mysterious, is now
bright and attractive.&mdash;They shed a glorious light on
the person of Jesus.&mdash;By them we understand why
he who was "holy, harmless, undefiled, and separate
from sinners," was treated with such contempt and
cruelty. We no longer see this part of God's moral
government, as "through a glass darkly." The veil
which is cast around his designs is withdrawn, and the
glorious scheme of redemption bursts forth to our
astonished senses, sparkling with wisdom, justice,
mercy, and love. By them, we are taught that Jesus
suffered, not for any sin of his own, but for the sins of
his people. The prophet is particular on this point.
The life and conduct of Jesus proved him exempt
from all the corrupt principles and evil passions of the
children of men. He alone is free from imperfection,
and his character forms the most perfect model of all
that is lovely, amiable, and exalted. In him was no
sin, and even the unjust judge who delivered him for
crucifixion, was compelled to declare he could find
nothing worthy of death against him; no, nor yet
Herod, for he had sent Jesus to him. No doubt both
Herod and Pilate examined his conduct with eagle-eyes,
and gladly would have discovered, if possible,
something which might give them a plea for condemning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
a man who so publicly declared himself the Messiah.
The Jews had looked forward to his coming
with much pleasure, for they considered he would
deliver them from the Roman yoke, under which they
then groaned. The slightest shadow of guilt would
have been sufficient for the purpose of these partial
Governors, and it deserves observation, that Jesus
was brought before them on a charge of perverting
the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to C&#230;sar,
saying that he was Christ, a King. But they can
prove nothing against him, for the more his character
is examined, the brighter it shines; and they are
compelled to confess, "they can find nothing worthy
of death against him." Pilate, from a clear conviction
that Jesus was innocent, proposes to release him;
but finding that he would draw on himself the malice
and hatred of the priests, like a time-serving judge,
he gave sentence as they desired, and in the same
moment in which he declared he could find no fault
in Jesus, did he deliver him over for crucifixion. Yet
Pilate could not conceal the horrors of an accusing
conscience; sensible of the black injustice of his
conduct he took water and washed his hands before
the multitude, saying, "I am innocent of the blood
of this just person, see ye to it." The people said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
"his blood be on us, and on our children." In what
court of judicature shall we find such another instance?
We believe, in none. Never did any one suffer more
unjustly than Jesus, if viewed as a private person;
but these verses teach us to look upon him as the
sinner's surety. Man, from his original corruption
and actual transgression, is justly exposed to the condemnation
of the law he has so much dishonoured.
"All we like sheep have gone astray, we have forsaken
the Lord's ways, and turned every one to his
own ways." "We have all done that which we ought
not to have done, and have left undone that which
we ought to have done, and there is no health in us."
We have no just plea why the sentence, "let the
wicked be turned into hell, and all the nations who
forget God," be not executed on us. We must lay
our hand upon our mouth before the tribunal of God,
who is an impartial and righteous Judge, for we justly
deserve the curses of the broken law to fall on us.
The Divine Being (be it spoken with reverence) cannot,
without injustice to himself, and dishonour to his
law, (which is holy, just, and good,) allow the guilty
to go free. Man must suffer the punishment consequent
on his offences, or God must lay aside his
justice, which is impossible, for it is an attribute essential<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
to his existence. The debtor must suffer, unless
some one be found to discharge the debt for him.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Die he, or justice must; unless for him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some other able, and as willing, pay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rigid satisfaction, death for death.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10"><span class="smcap">Paradise Lost</span>, b. iii.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But where shall we find the man who can, by any
means, "redeem his brother, or give to God a
ransom for his soul?" Nowhere; it is quite impossible
for any mere man to deliver his own soul, and
much more the soul of another. An angel, or all
the mighty hosts of angels, cannot do it; they are the
creatures of God's power, and consequently finite;
and therefore cannot satisfy the justice of God, which
is infinite. The mind of man could never have discovered
a proper person. Human intellect is utterly
unable to the task; it is incapable of soaring to such
a height. But though man cannot find a surety, God
has pointed one out, even Jesus, his own well-beloved
son, who is the second person in the revealed order of
the trinity; with him it is "no robbery to be equal
with God;" for he is one with the Father, as touching
his Godhead. Yet this great and glorious Personage
voluntarily engaged to become the surety of his people;
to expiate their guilt by suffering all the punishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
due to them for sin.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> In the fulness of time, this
great head of his church left the joys of Heaven, and
the praises of adoring saints and angels, to tabernacle
on earth. Having veiled his glory beneath the human
nature, which he took into union with his divine person,
he came forth to accomplish the work he had, from
the foundation of the world, covenanted to perform.
As the surety, representative, and head of his people,
he submitted to endure all the curses of the moral
law they had broken. The Lord having accepted him
in their place, and laid (by imputation) their iniquities
on him, he also on him laid their punishment. Nor
was it a mitigated punishment; he bore the whole
weight of wo due to them. It is true, he did not go
into hell, which was a part of the sentence denounced
on guilty man; but he was not exempt from the
buffeting of Satan. He was exposed to his malice in
the garden; and when on the cross, he might be said
to be in Satan's territories; for he is declared to be
"the Prince of the power of the air," and having
shot forth his most fiery darts, he appears to leave the
scene of conflict like a triumphant conqueror, for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
adversary is beheld breathless on the field of battle.
Jesus needed not to descend into those abodes of wo
to feel their sorrows, for he is heard to exclaim, that
the pains of hell had got hold upon him. It is not the
place, but the extent, and the kind of suffering, which
constitutes misery; and Jesus felt it in a much greater
degree, than even the miserable inhabitants of that
wretched place, where hope never enters. They suffer
for themselves as individuals, but he endured the
weight of wo for a multitude so great, that no man
can number them. Theirs are the sufferings of creatures,
his was the sufferings of the infinite Creator;
and this it is which gives such value, efficacy, and
dignity, to all he did and suffered. His were the
actions of one of Adam's race, for it was the children
of earth who had rebelled, and whom he came to
redeem; but what renders it beneficial to man, is
that he is both God and man in one person. This
union stamps a value upon his work: Jesus, by the
dignity of his person, has made full satisfaction; yea,
his sufferings have more than compensated for the
indignity offered to God by sin. It has given a
greater honour to God's holy law, than could have
been done by the unsinning obedience of men and
angels through time and eternity, for Jesus perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
fulfilled all the commands of the moral law, and by
that obedience he exalted, and made it honourable,
and then suffered the penalty it denounced on the
violators of its precepts. All his active and passive
obedience was performed as the head of his people,
and for their benefit. "Surely he hath borne our
griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem
him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. But he
was wounded for our transgressions; he was bruised
for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was
upon him, and with his stripes we are healed. All
we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned
every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on
him the iniquity of us all." We must look beyond
the Roman governors, soldiers, and the Jewish priests
and people, to behold sin, as the great cause of all
the buffetings, wounds, bruises, pains, and sorrows,
of Jesus. This was the fruitful source of all his wo.
Would you behold the justice of God? then look at
the suffering Jesus, and remember that it was not <em>his
own</em>, but <em>imputed</em>, guilt. Would you know the mercy
of God, and see a display of his love to man? then
look at Jesus. Let it sink deep into your heart, and
may your soul be influenced by the truth, that "God
so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish,
but have everlasting life." "For God can be just,
and yet the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus."
"He that believeth in him is not condemned; but he
that believeth not, is condemned already; because he
hath not believed in the name of the only-begotten
Son of God." "For there is none other name under
heaven given amongst men, whereby we must be
saved." "He that believeth on the Son, hath everlasting
life: and he that believeth not the Son, shall
not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him."
In the work of redemption by Jesus, we behold
"mercy and truth meet together; righteousness and
peace kiss each other."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LVIII.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>For thou wilt not leave my soul in Hell, neither wilt thou
suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.&mdash;Psalm xvi. 9, 10.</p></blockquote>


<p>These words are not applicable to David, for
after he had served his generation, he fell asleep, and
his body, interred in the royal sepulchre of the kings
of Judah, which was in the city of David, saw corruption.
The sentence "dust thou art, and unto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
dust shalt thou return," has, for many a generation,
been accomplished on Jesse's Royal Son. The remains
of this mighty monarch cannot now be distinguished
from those of earth's meanest slave. They
are alike mingled in the dust of death, and must
remain hid from the eye of man until the archangel's
trump shall sound, and the command be given, Arise,
ye dead, and come to judgment. The hell (in Hebrew,
scheol) here alluded to, cannot be that place of
torment, prepared for the devil and his angels, from
which a soul never did or will escape. When once
consigned to that abode of wo, there is a great gulf
fixed, even the unchangeable decree of Omnipotence;
a barrier stronger than walls of brass, and cannot
be surmounted, or destroyed.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> The word here rendered
hell, (in the Greek, hades,) is the same as the
Jews, before the Babylonish captivity, used for the
grave, and is the sense in which it must be here understood.
This verse is prophetic of the resurrection
of the Messiah; which doctrine is taught in many
parts of the Old Testament, by type, figure, and
prophecy; in the New, we behold it clearly confirmed
by the resurrection of Jesus. The circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
attending this great event are repeatedly described,
and the evidence clear and conclusive. The witnesses
to this important fact are not few; both enemies and
friends unite in giving their testimony to his death
and resurrection. The soldiers having taken the dead
body of Jesus from the cross, his friends deposit it
in the tomb. We cannot but stop here, and admire
the overruling hand of Providence in the more minute
circumstances connected with the interment of the
body of the Redeemer. The sepulchre was hewn out
of the solid rock. No access could be gained to it
but by one opening, on which a ponderous stone was
placed, a seal set thereon, and the entrance strictly
guarded by Roman soldiers. But wherefore all this
care and attention over the dead body of one crucified
at Golgotha? It is by order of the High Priest and
Pharisees, who had requested Pilate to allow them to
make the grave sure, as Jesus had declared he would
rise again after three days. They, fully convinced of
his death, and disbelieving his divinity, fear that the
disciples should steal the dead body of their Master,
and declare that he had risen; and thus the last error
would be worse than the first. But we have cause to
rejoice that they used so much caution, for it tends to
establish the truth, and confirm the testimony, of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
disciples. It fully proves the death and burial of
Jesus, and that the body did not remain in the grave.
On the first day of the week, certain women of the
company hasted early to the sepulchre, to embalm,
after the custom of the east, the body of their beloved
Master; but lo, to their astonishment and grief, it is
gone! They indeed see the place where the Lord had
lain; for an angel, by an earthquake, had rolled
away the stone; at whose appearance the keepers
became as dead men; but to the women, filled with
sorrow and surprise on not finding the body of their
Lord, this heavenly messenger proclaimed the resurrection
of that Jesus whom they sought. And as
they run to tell the disciples, Jesus himself met them,
saying, All hail! and they held him by the feet, and
worshipped him. Some of the watch, also, went into
the city, and told the Chief Priests all that was done;
who, having assembled a council, give large sums of
money to the soldiers to say, that the disciples came
by night, and stole him away, whilst they slept.
This report, though commonly believed amongst the
Jews until this day, will not bear examination. The
more we consider this tale, the clearer will the fact of
the resurrection of Jesus appear. If the body was
<em>indeed</em> stolen, why are the soldiers allowed to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
unpunished for their neglect, as they say it was
stolen whilst they slept. We should not expect to
find a Roman sentinel asleep at his post of duty,
for their military discipline was the most severe in the
world. Even if the soldiers had fallen asleep whilst
watching the entrance of the sepulchre, it appears
impossible for a number of persons to remove so ponderous
a stone without considerable noise and bustle,
or to pass among the guards without awaking some of
them. But even allowing the body to have been gone
whilst they slept, how could they possibly know, that it
was the disciples who had taken it? But is it at all
probable, that a few timid disciples, who had fled from
their Master on his first apprehension, should now dare
to go, in the face of a guard of Roman soldiers, justly
famed for their courage, and attempt to steal, and
much more to carry off, the body! Let it be observed,
that though the disciples had hoped Jesus "had
been he who would have redeemed Israel;" yet,
when they saw him laid in the grave, all their hopes
that he was the Messiah fled, for the minds of the disciples
were strongly tainted by the Jewish prejudice,
that the Messiah's would be a temporal kingdom.
Their dreams of earthly splendour now vanished, and
they were about to return to their occupations in common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
life; in fact, some had done so. Is it reasonable
to imagine that the others would engage in a plan
fraught with danger, for the sake of obtaining the
body of one, in whom they began to imagine themselves
deceived? Besides, what advantage could
they hope to gain by such a scheme? What end
was it designed to answer? They could not expect
to keep the act concealed; and if discovered, they
were fully convinced it would bring upon them the
severest punishment. But if, as the soldiers proclaimed,
the disciples did steal him away, why are
these handful of fishermen allowed to retain possession?
Why did not the Chief Priest, at the head of
the Jewish Sanhedrim, supported by the Roman
authority, instantly compel them to surrender the
body? Why are not these men of Galilee brought to
a judicial tribunal, examined, and openly punished,
that the truth of the soldiers' tale may bear even the
<em>appearance of</em> fact? Surely this neglect is most extraordinary
in men who had shown such vigilant care
over the body when in the tomb. The more we examine
the conduct of the parties, the more inconsistent
does the Jewish tale appear. It is evident, the
disciples were as ignorant as the rest of the nation, as
to what the resurrection from the dead should mean.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Jesus had again and again preached the doctrine,
yet they were at the first as backward as his enemies
to believe the fact, and discovered much unbelief on
the first tidings of the great event. The incredulity
of all of them is a strong presumption, that as they
did not expect Jesus to rise from the grave, so neither
did they steal the body, and falsely proclaim their
Master risen. We have a still further confirmation
of the fact from the events that followed. In the
interval of forty days, between his resurrection and
ascension, Jesus appeared to many of his disciples,
and showed himself alive by many infallible proofs;
the women who went early to their Lord's sepulchre,
were first honoured with the sight of the risen Redeemer.
He afterwards appeared to the two sorrowing
disciples as they walked to Emmaus, then to the
eleven as they sat at meat with the doors closed, and,
eight days after, he again appeared to them, when the
incredulous Thomas exclaimed, "My Lord and my
God!" He also showed himself to the seven disciples
who were fishing at the sea of Tiberius; after that, he
was seen of above five hundred brethren at once;
and, though some had fallen asleep, yet, when the
Apostle wrote, the greater part were then alive, and
could testify to the truth of these things. How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
"vain the watch, the stone, the seal!" the grave
could not contain the prisoner. Jesus burst the bands
of death, and arose the triumphant victor. It was
necessary that he, as the Head and Representative of
his church, should conquer death and the grave for them.
He died "that through death he might destroy him
that had the power of death, that is, the devil." He
laid in the grave that he might subdue the power of
the grave. He, as a surety, became subject unto death
as a part of the curse; but, having paid the full ransom,
justice demanded his release. Having satisfied the
demands of the law, it was right that he should be
honourably acquitted. Though "delivered for our
offences, he must be raised again for our justification."
The resurrection proves his atonement was
accepted by God as fully adequate to all the requirements
of justice, and declares him to be the Son of
God with power. It is by reason of the incapacity of
the damned in hell, to take in the full measure of God's
wrath due to them for their sins, that their punishment,
though it be eternal, yet never satisfies; because
they can never endure all as Christ could, and
did; theirs is truly less than what Christ underwent;
and, therefore, his punishment ought not in justice to be
eternal, as theirs, because he could more fully satisfy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
God's wrath in a few hours than they could to all
eternity. By his complete satisfaction, the costly,
inestimable price of redemption is paid, and the sinner's
surety released from all the claims of the Law and
justice. "Christ is risen from the dead, and become
the first fruits of them that slept." Do we not hear
him exclaim, "Thy dead men shall live together; with
my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that
dwell in the dust." "I will ransom them from the
power of the grave; I will redeem them from death.
O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be
thy destruction." May we not join in happy chorus,
"O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy
victory? The sting of death is sin; and the strength
of sin is the law. But, thanks be to God, which
giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LIX.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive;
thou hast received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious also,
that the Lord God might dwell amongst them.&mdash;Psalm lxviii.
18.</p></blockquote>


<p>We find amid the records of the Old Testament,
very distinguished honour was conferred by God on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
two illustrious personages, whom he was pleased to
exempt from the common lot of humanity, and admit
into the Celestial City, by a new, and, till then, untrodden
path. Their way led not across the dark
valley of the shadow of death; they entered Canaan
without passing the banks of Jordan's stormy
waters. God was pleased to translate the bodies of
Enoch and Elijah to heaven, without an execution of
the sentence "dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou
return." This was assuredly a high mark of favour;
but we are in this verse presented with an event, in
comparison with which, the cases of Enoch and Elijah
sink into insignificance. It is a description of the
return of a great and mighty conqueror, who, surrounded
by the trophies of his victories, appears at
court to receive the thanks and rewards his services so
well deserve. And who is this mighty conqueror?
It is Jesus! See him surrounded by the little band of
faithful followers, on whom he bestows his parting
blessing; having bidden them an affectionate farewell,
he, with conscious majesty, mounts the air, and soars
beyond the eagle's path, through the vast extent of
space. Though he goes forth unattended, it is not
long a secret that the victorious Saviour is on his way
to the heavenly kingdom; for the myriads of spirits,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
who are anxiously watching his motions, no sooner
observe that he bends his course toward the Celestial
City, but they instantly proclaim the joyful news to
its inhabitants; who, with holy impatience, are all
anxious to fly on the wings of love and adoration to
meet and welcome this illustrious Conqueror back to
the realms of bliss. Wide are thrown the golden
gates, and as they open, ten thousand voices are heard
chaunting in chorus; "Lift up your heads, O ye
gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and
the King of glory shall come in. Who is this King of
glory? The Lord, strong and mighty; the Lord,
mighty in battle. Lift up your heads, O ye gates;
even lift them up, ye everlasting doors; and the King
of glory shall come in. Who is this King of glory?
The Lord of Hosts, he is the King of glory." Forth
from heaven's portals there issued a goodly band, singing
as they advance to meet and welcome their victorious
King, whom they convey in celestial triumph to
the presence of the eternal Father; seated on his
throne of glory, he receives, with ineffable delight
and joy, this, his only-begotten, always well-beloved,
but now still more endeared Son, the Glorious
Deliverer of the children of men. Great was the joy of
that illustrious day, when the eternal Son of God,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
entered the city of the new Jerusalem, as the victorious
Conqueror of sin, death, and hell, whom he led
as captives to adorn his triumph, for, "having spoiled
principalities and powers, he made a show of them
openly, triumphing over them, and ascended on high,
leading captivity captive." Then the eternal hills resounded
to the melodious sound of ten thousand times
ten thousand voices, who sing aloud, "Worthy is the
Lamb that was slain, to receive power, and riches, and
wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and
blessing." Then all in heaven said, "Blessing, and
honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that
sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb, for ever,
and ever." The spirits of the redeemed vie with elect
angels, in testifying their love, reverence, and gratitude
to the God of their salvation. They knew, if
the eternal Son of God had not become their surety,
not one of Adam's race could ever have entered the
realms of bliss.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> But in the eternal council of peace,
he did covenant and promise, in the fulness of time,
to become a sacrifice, and God who knew him to
be faithful, did, on the credit of that promise, save all
the Old Testament saints.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Jesus had now fulfilled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
that engagement; paid the full price of their redemption;
"blotted out the hand-writing of ordinances
that was against them, taking it away by nailing
it to his cross." What wonder, if his return was
hailed with rapturous delight; his presence could not
fail of adding fresh joy to the happy spirits of the redeemed
in glory. Yes! Jesus has "ascended on high,
he has led captivity captive, and received gifts for
men." It is as the God-Man, it is in his human
nature, that he is said to receive gifts; for, as God,
all is his in common with the Father. It is in the
office of Mediator, that he has "all power given him
in heaven and on earth." It is as God-Man, that
the Father set him "at his right hand, in the heavenly
places; far above all principality, and power, and
might, and dominion, and every name that is named,
not only in this world, but also in that which is to
come; and hath put all things under his feet, and
gave him to be the head over all things to the church."
He is made the great Almoner of heaven, and he
disposes of his gifts to the children of earth. He has
received freely, and he gives freely,&mdash;witness the
showers of ascension gifts, on the day of Pentecost. He
then, as the apostle quotes the words, "gave gifts to
men, yea, to the rebellious also, that the Lord God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
might dwell among them." But while we view Christ
as glorified, let us not fail to connect the scenes of
Gethsemane and Calvary. The new song in heaven,
to which their golden harps are ever tuned, is to the
praise of him "who was slain, and has redeemed us
to God by his blood, out of every kindred, and tongue,
and people, and nation; and has made us unto our
God kings and priests for ever."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LX.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out
my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters
shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, and your
young men shall see visions: and also upon the servants and
upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit.&mdash;Joel
ii. 28, 29.</p></blockquote>


<p>That part of the prophet Joel from which this
verse is selected, is highly interesting; and although
not strictly prophetical of the person of the Messiah,
yet it is so closely connected that it cannot be severed
without injury to the whole. In fact, it serves as a
test, whereby we may prove if Jesus be in truth that
Messiah, of whom "Moses and the prophets did
write." The "afterward" here noticed, alludes to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
the coming of the Messiah, after which great day of
the Lord, the promise here made, of a glorious outpouring
of the spirit, was to be fulfilled. It will be
alike easy and delightful, to trace its accomplishment.
The Holy Spirit, from the earliest ages of the world,
has shed his sacred influences over the church; but
no visible or open display of that divine person, God
the Holy Ghost, had ever been made. That great
event was reserved until after the Messiah's appearance;
and, when that illustrious person had publicly
manifested himself to the world, then was this promise
to be fulfilled. Jesus declared himself to be the second
person, in the revealed order of the Holy Trinity&mdash;the
eternal Son of God&mdash;Christ the Messiah; and in
such character he promised, when returned to glory, to
send down the Holy Spirit. Again and again did Jesus
direct his disciples to expect that event. On the last
great day of the feast, he publicly proclaimed in the
temple its near approach, and promised its fulfilment;
"for the Holy Ghost was not yet given, because that
Jesus was not yet glorified." When the faithful disciples
were overwhelmed with grief, on learning from their
beloved Master that he was shortly to leave them,
Jesus cheered their drooping spirits with the promise of
another Comforter, even the Spirit of truth; whom he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
would send from the Father. To reconcile them still
more to his departure, he told them "it was expedient
for them that he should go away," for, "if he
went not away the Comforter would not come; but if
he departed, he would send him unto them." After his
resurrection, Jesus again taught the disciples to expect
this great event, and on the morning of his ascension
he repeated his promise, adding, as it would not
be many days hence, they should tarry at Jerusalem
until its accomplishment. After the ascension of
Jesus, the disciples were so fully persuaded that he was
the Christ of God, that they continued daily assembled
together, waiting for the fulfilment of the great promise
made to them by their risen Lord.</p>

<p>It will be remembered, that all the Israelitish males
were commanded to appear, three times in the year,
before the Lord at Jerusalem, at the feasts of Passover,
Pentecost, and Tabernacles. The feast of Pentecost
or weeks, was celebrated fifty days after the Passover.
It was at the first great Jewish festival, the Passover,
that Jesus was crucified. He arose from the dead on
the third day, and as forty days intervened between his
resurrection and return to glory, there could be only
seven days from his ascension until the feast of Pentecost.
It was on the morning of the ever-memorable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
day of Pentecost, the disciples being all of one accord,
in one place; that "suddenly there came a sound from
heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and filled all
the house, where they were assembled; and there appeared
cloven tongues, like as of fire, and sat upon
each of them, and they were all filled with the Holy
Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the
Spirit gave them utterance." Such a miraculous
event was soon noised abroad, and multitudes crowd to
learn the fact. As the Holy Spirit was graciously
pleased to make this open display of his person and
godhead, at one of the great Jewish festivals, the
number of strangers who usually resorted to Jerusalem
at that season, either for the purposes of worship or
trade, became witnesses of the miraculous gifts bestowed
on those hitherto unlearned, and many of them
unlettered, Galilean fishermen. The inhabitants of
Galilee were proverbial for their dulness and stupidity;<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
yet these men were taught, in an instant of
time, to speak, with ease and fluency, languages whose
very names, it is more than probable, they were an hour
before unable to pronounce correctly. An opportunity
was instantly offered for the apostles openly to display<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
their extraordinary gifts. Amidst the assembled
throng were men of sixteen different nations, to whom
these poor fishermen publicly proclaimed, in their
several languages, or dialects, the wonderful works of
God. They needed no interpreter, in addressing this
motley crowd. How preposterous to accuse the apostles
of drunkenness! Truly, we should not imagine a state
of inebriety the best calculated for acquiring a knowledge
of any of the learned languages. We seldom
know men, (however well their heads are furnished,) in
a state of intoxication, speak any thing except it be
the language of foolishness. Beside, it was only the
third hour of the day, (nine o'clock) the time of
offering the daily morning sacrifice in the temple,
before which hour the Jews were forbidden to take
any refreshment; and, as this was a solemn festival,
no doubt the command was then more strictly observed.
How mild, yet energetic, the reply of Peter,
who declared the event to be a fulfilment of the prophecy
of Joel, accomplished on the return of Jesus to
glory; "when being by the right hand of God exalted,
and having received of the Father the promise of
the Holy Ghost, he had shed forth that which they
then saw and heard." The appearance of the Holy
Spirit was sufficient to prove his personality. Might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
not the sound from heaven, as of a rushing mighty
wind, be designed to show that the operations of God
the Holy Spirit, are like the unknown and unexplored
sources of the air. "The wind bloweth where
it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof; but
canst not tell whence it cometh, or whither it goeth:
so is every one that is born of the Spirit." This was
a lesson taught Nicodemus by Jesus, the wisdom and
word of God.</p>

<p>On Shinar's plains, the Lord, to testify his divine
displeasure, confounded the language of mankind. It
was a curse pronounced on Babel's tower; but at Pentecost,
the Holy Spirit was pleased to use the diversity
of language as a witness of his almighty power and
Godhead; when he publicly and solemnly ordained
the apostles ministers of the everlasting Gospel, and
endowed them with extraordinary gifts, as the first
ambassadors of Christ, sent forth to publish unto all
nations the glad tidings of great joy.</p>

<p>Might we not be tempted, when viewing the immoral
and profane amusements of Whitsuntide, to imagine
it an annual feast holden to Venus or Bacchus; instead
of (as at first designed) a solemn festival, intended to
commemorate the visible descent of the Spirit of
Purity? Certainly the general character of the public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
assemblies, at that season, bears a much nearer resemblance
to the sports holden in honour of the
deified heroes in heathen mythology, than to the pure
and spiritual nature of the Divine Person, whose first
public appearance in our world it was wished annually
to celebrate. What would the early disciples of
Christ feel, could they behold the sad perversion of
this sacred festival!</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER LXI.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>And I will pour upon the House of David, and upon the
inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and of supplications;
and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced,
and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son,
and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness
for his first born.&mdash;Zech. xii. 10.</p></blockquote>


<p>The Prophet Zechariah here presents to our view
one of the richest jewels in the treasury of God's promises.
It sparkles clear and bright amid the records
of divine truth. All earth's richest treasures cannot
offer an adequate remuneration for the withdrawment
of this precious promise. The words deserve our most
careful examination. We will therefore consider
the person here promising; the persons to whom the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
promise is made; the thing promised; and search
for proofs of its fulfilment.</p>

<p>The person here promising is the God-Man, Christ
Jesus, for the words are, "I will pour, &amp;c. &amp;c.,
and they shall look upon me, whom they have
pierced, and mourn." We never find God the
Father using such language as this when speaking
of his disobedient creatures. God is justly displeased
at man's apostasy. His law is dishonoured, his works
defaced and injured by sin. Yet God, as God,
cannot be the subject of pain and sorrow, he is
beyond their reach. But if we look at the God-Man,
Christ Jesus, we behold his sacred head
pierced with a thorny crown, his hands and feet
with nails of iron, his side with the soldier's spear, and
his soul with the wrath of God. He who suffered thus
on earth, did, as God, make this gracious promise.</p>

<p>The persons to whom this promise literally applies,
are the Jews, whose restoration as a nation to the
divine favour, will form a prominent feature in the
latter-day glories of the Church. The Lord has promised
to gather together the dispersed in Judah, and
the outcasts of Israel. "The deliverer shall arise
out of Zion, and turn away ungodliness from Jacob."
This nation, who once refused and crucified the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
Messiah, shall, when partakers of this promised
blessing, "look upon him whom they have pierced,
and mourn." This promise is not confined to the
Jews, but extends to the fallen race of Adam, whom
our spiritual David will make inhabitants of the new
Jerusalem, which is above, without regard to their
being of Jewish or Gentile extraction.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> He will not
consider the trifling distinctions of colour, language,
or nation, a barrier of such importance as to preclude
their participating in his blessings.</p>

<p>The thing promised is an abundant outpouring of the
Holy Spirit. Adam, by his apostasy, lost the image of
God stamped upon his soul at his creation. The sentence,
"in the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely
die," was not suffered to go unexecuted. From that
hapless hour, his soul, the most noble part, was dead to
all spiritual life, and became the abode of corroding
passions and depraved principles. He immediately
shrank from holding intercourse with God, and tried
to hide himself from the presence of his benefactor.
As Adam begat a son in his own fallen likeness, all
his race partake of the same corrupt nature. We are
ignorant of God and his ways. We need divine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
teaching; we cannot naturally understand the things
of God, which are spiritual, the eye of our understanding
being darkened; God is not in all our thoughts; we
are averse to communion with the Father of Spirits.
We despise his offers of free grace&mdash;we prefer to be
saved by our own rather than God's method&mdash;we see
no beauty in Jesus that we should desire him&mdash;we
dislike to renounce our own, and trust in his complete
righteousness&mdash;we consider his commands grievous,
and the language of our soul is, "we will not
have this man to reign over us." But we are here
told of a sovereign antidote for these deep-seated moral
disorders of the soul. Here is a gracious promise of an
abundant outpouring of the Holy Spirit, whose office
it is to "convince of sin, of righteousness, and of
judgment." He convinces the soul, into which he
enters, of the exceeding sinfulness of sin&mdash;that it is the
evil thing which God hates; and shows the divine law
is spiritual, extending to the thoughts and intents of
the heart.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> He puts a cry for mercy into the soul,
destroys the natural enmity of the mind against God's
plan of salvation, and makes the object of his divine
teaching willing and anxious to partake of the Lord's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
bounty, and be a debtor to mercy alone. The Holy
Spirit teaches of righteousness by convincing that a
better righteousness than our own tattered rags is
absolutely necessary, ere we can see the face of God
with peace. He makes the soul willing to be clothed
with the wedding garment of Jesus' righteousness,
which is the fine linen of the saints. It is indispensable
that we be clothed with this livery of the court
of Heaven, or we shall be denied admission into the
mansions of the King of Glory. Would we behold
the fulfilment of this prophetic promise, then let us
direct our minds back to a survey of the glorious scenes
exhibited on the ever memorable day of Pentecost,
when the Spirit was, in so free and copious a manner,
poured out from on high. Attend to the sermon
Peter preached on the day of his ordination; mark its
effects on the three thousand of the House of David,
inhabitants of Jerusalem's much-famed city. Listen
to their cry, "Men and brethren, what must we do?"
Surely these were none of the stout hearts who dared
even to crucify the Lord of life and glory? The
same! yet how different their tone&mdash;how altered their
conduct! To what cause can we attribute this astonishing
change in the minds of three thousand persons
in the same instant of time? Surely it was none<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
other than the almighty work of God the Holy Ghost.
It was his influence on the minds of these men which
produced the Spirit of grace and supplication, and
taught them to direct the anxious cry and supplicating
look unto him whom they had pierced. Was not the
anguish of their souls, under a sense of their sins, equal
to the exquisite sorrow of those who bitterly bewail
the death of their first-born? However skilfully Peter
might wield the sword of the Spirit, (the word of God,)
it was none other than the God of all grace, who
directed and sent it home with saving power to the
hearts and consciences of these Jerusalem sinners.
Are not the other triumphs of the Spirit worthy of
regard, when five thousand are made willing cordially
to embrace Christ crucified? May we not, by the
way, observe, that the reception of the Gospel by such
numbers so immediately after the ascension of Jesus,
proved the truth of the facts recorded by the apostles,
of the life, death, resurrection, and ascension
of Christ? Many, no doubt, of these early converts
of Christianity, had been eye-witnesses of several of
the events, and <em>all</em> had an opportunity of discovering
the deception, if there had existed any, in the apostles'
narrative. But no sooner are they persuaded
to compare the Old Testament prophecies concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
the Messiah, with all the circumstances in the history
of Jesus of Nazareth, than they anxiously desire to
be enlisted under the banners of the cross. Unable
to resist the force of truth, they join the persecuted
adherents of the crucified Jesus, and cast in their lot
with his despised followers, although "a sect every
where spoken against." When were converts to Christianity
most numerous? Was it not when there
existed the best possible opportunity of detecting the
least imposition or falsehood, on the part of the writers
of the New Testament? Let it not be forgotten that
those early converts were neither won by the arm of
worldly power, nor bribed by proffered gold. On the
contrary, no sooner did they embrace the Gospel, but
they were met at the very threshold by ignominy and
persecution in every varied and frightful form, sufficiently
terrific to deter all but men really convinced of
the truth, and swayed by its sacred influence.</p>

<p>But we must not confine the accomplishment of
this promise entirely to the days of Pentecost, although
it then assumed a more splendid and attractive appearance,
than it has done in these latter times. Yet
through each succeeding age, the Lord the Spirit has
not been unmindful of his covenant engagements.
Could we draw aside the veil that separates between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
us and the holy of holies&mdash;could we obtain a glimpse
of the inhabitants of the New Jerusalem which is
above, and inquire of the goodly number that surround
the throne of God and the Lamb, Who was the faithful
instructor and guide, that taught them to walk in
the way that led to everlasting life? they would direct
us to the Lord the Spirit, as the almighty guide who
pointed out the road, and taught their wandering feet
to tread the strait, the narrow way, the only path, that
leads to Zion's hill. In the Bible, that chart of life,
the road is shown with clearness, and described with
accuracy. It is called faith in the finished salvation
of Christ, and obedience to his commands. The hand
which drew this path to glory, is the very same that
painted the splendid canopy of heaven. By this good
old way, all the patriarchs, prophets, apostles, martyrs,
and reformers, entered the city of the Lord of Hosts.
Their guide and comforter, through this waste howling
wilderness, was the third person of the Triune-Jehovah.
What countless myriads has this almighty guide led
to the mount of God, from the antediluvian worthies,
down to the happy spirit just entered into the joy of
its Lord! Like them, led by the same unerring teacher,
we shall not fail of arriving safely at the mansion of
everlasting joy, for he is the only faithful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
conductor<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>to the heavenly Jerusalem; untaught by him,
none can find the path of life, but will assuredly
stumble on the dark mountains of sin and error, and
run the downward road that leads to hell.</p>

<p>Eternal life is the gift of God. Christ is "the
way, the truth, and the life: none can come unto God,
but by him." The office of the Holy Spirit is to
instruct the ignorant, comfort the mourners in Zion,
and make us meet to be "partakers of the inheritance
of the saints in light." "If ye, being evil, know how
to give good gifts unto your children, how much more
will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them
that ask him." May we be partakers of that inestimable
blessing, for without <em>his</em> influence on our hearts,
vain will be even the electing love of God the Father&mdash;vain
the vicarious sacrifice and imputed righteousness
of Christ the Son&mdash;vain to us the plan of salvation;
and vain, all the promises of the Gospel. As well for
us, if those glad tidings of great joy, "Glory to God in
the highest, and on earth peace, good-will toward men,"
had not reached our ears. Unapplied, the most sovereign
remedy is useless, for then not even Gilead's
balm, can heal the dire disease.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Christ will prove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
no Saviour to us, unless applied to our individual case.
It is the office of the Holy Spirit, to take of the things
of Christ and show them unto us. Faith is the hand
by which we grasp Christ crucified. That saving
faith, by which we apprehend the finished salvation of
Jesus, and make it our own, is a grace wrought in the
heart by the operation of the Spirit of God. Far
better would it be for the children of men, if the sun
were turned into darkness, the moon into blood, and all
the stars of heaven withdraw their shining; than that
this glorious promise of the outpouring of the Spirit,
should be blotted from the book of God's remembrance!</p>

<p>May that blessed morning shortly dawn, "when all
shall know the Lord!" Hasten, glorious Immanuel,
that bright day, when "the whole earth shall be full
of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the
sea."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXII.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>The Lord hath sworn and will not repent, thou art a priest
for ever, after the order of Melchizedek.&mdash;Psalm cx. 4.</p></blockquote>


<p>In the Old Testament, we find but little recorded of
Melchizedek, that venerable priest of the most High<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
God, who met and blessed the patriarch Abraham as
he returned victorious from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer
and the confederate kings. But from that little,
we are led to regard him as a person of distinction.
To him, the great father of the faithful and friend
of God presented the tithes or tenths of the spoil.
It is from the prophetical word of the royal Psalmist,
"the Lord hath sworn and will not repent, thou art a
Priest for ever, after the order of Melchizedek," that
we are taught to view this ancient priest of God as
a type: and of whom, if not of Christ? Paul, in his
epistle to the Hebrews,<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> speaks largely on the subject;
he proves the fulfilment of the prophecy, and
declares, that Christ's priestly office was prefigured in
the person of Melchizedek, to Abraham the father of
the Israelitish race. In the same epistle, we find
blended the priesthood of Aaron, in order to show the
vast superiority of that of Christ over the other two,
though both instituted by God himself. But as we
find no prophecy respecting the Aaronic priesthood,
we make no further reference to that subject, in order
to attend more immediately to the words, "The Lord
hath sworn, and will not repent, thou art a priest for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
ever, after the order of Melchizedek." Was this
priest of the most High God honoured with the title
of King of Salem&mdash;by interpretation, King of Righteousness,
and King of Peace? Is not Jesus proclaimed
King of Zion; the Lord our Righteousness, and the
Prince of Peace? Nor are these mere empty titles,
but real characters, and offices, sustained by Him,
who "abideth a priest upon his throne for ever." We
have no historical account of the parentage or descendants
of Melchizedek; he is presented to us as
"without father, without mother, without descent,
having neither beginning of days, nor end of life;"
but being made like unto the Son of God, abideth a
priest continually.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> And Christ's priesthood was not
derived by genealogy, or succession, he had neither
father or mother of the family of Aaron, from whom
his priesthood could descend. It is evident our Lord
sprang "out of Judah, of which tribe no man gave
attendance at the altar;"<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> neither did Christ die and
leave it to others, by way of descent, but was constituted
a single priest, without predecessor or successor.
"He abideth a priest for ever, after the order of
Melchizedek." It is impossible for a finite mind to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
comprehend the eternal sonship of the Son of God,
whom the Father, before the foundation of the world,
constituted a priest for ever; and therefore, the priesthood
of Melchizedek was instituted to prefigure to us
the nature of Christ's eternal priesthood. "The Lord
hath sworn and will not repent, thou art a priest
for ever, after the order of Melchizedek." These
words deserve particular attention. It is God the
Father who swears to Christ; no oath of allegiance is
required from him who is constituted our Priest.
Jehovah, whose eye pierces through futurity, knew he
would be faithful in his office, and he freely and unreservedly
trusted him to maintain his divine honour
and justice, and accomplish the salvation of sinners.
The high-priestly office, though honourable, could not
add to Christ's dignity; but his glorious person did
confer honour and dignity upon the sacred office,
for he who is constituted our High Priest, "is fellow
to the Lord of Hosts." "Every high priest is ordained,
to offer both gifts and sacrifices," and great
was the sacrifice offered by Christ: he offered up himself;
he would borrow nothing, but was both priest,
sacrifice, altar, and temple: and "by that offering,
he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified."
"And because he continueth ever, he hath an unchangeable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
priesthood;" "wherefore he <em>is</em> able to save
them to the uttermost, that come unto God by him,
seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them."
Blessed Jesus! thou priest of Melchizedek's order,
while we would not withhold from thee a portion of all
that thou givest us, let us not rest satisfied, till we are
enabled to present "our bodies and souls a reasonable
sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto God."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXIII.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon
thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end
of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring
in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and
prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy. Know, therefore, and
understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to
restore and to build Jerusalem, unto the Messiah, the Prince,
shall be seven weeks, and three score and two weeks: the
street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous
times.&mdash;Daniel ix. 24, 25.</p></blockquote>


<p>The harps of Judah were silent&mdash;the disconsolate
Israelites hung them on the willows of Babylon&mdash;no
songs of Zion were heard in that land of captivity,
where, for seventy long years, they wore the galling
yoke of bondage, bereft of home and all its blessings&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
land of their forefathers in the possession of
strangers&mdash;Jerusalem in ruins&mdash;her palaces consumed&mdash;the
Temple destroyed&mdash;the spot trodden down by
the Heathen&mdash;themselves exposed to the taunts of their
conquerors, and compelled to bow before the idolatrous
image of Chaldean superstition.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> Well might Judah's
sons weep by the waters of Babylon, whose murmurings
recalled to their recollection the stream which
gushed from Horeb's mount.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> The remembrance of
past blessings increases the weight of present misery.
How changed their state, and changed to punish their
awful rebellions against the Lord of Sabaoth! Yet
the God of Israel was not unmindful of his promise&mdash;he
cheered their drooping spirits with the assurance
of speedy deliverance from their captive state. The
prayer of Daniel entered into the ears of the Lord
of Hosts&mdash;the command was given&mdash;swiftly the angel,
even Gabriel, flew to reveal his Lord's decrees unto
the mourning prophet&mdash;that "man greatly beloved"
of his God. Daniel was commissioned to foretel
the deliverance of the Jews from Babylon&mdash;the building
of Jerusalem and its walls in troublous times;
and to him, Jehovah was graciously pleased to renew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
the promise of the Prince, Messiah, whose appearance
all the patriarchs and prophets had foretold. The
nearer that glorious epoch approached, the more minutely
was it described. The Lord gave Daniel to
"know and understand, that from the going forth of
the commandment to restore and build Jerusalem
unto the Messiah, the Prince, should be seven weeks,
and three score and two weeks." The period here
styled weeks, is generally allowed to be sabbaths of
years. This appears to be the sense of the passage,
for the Jews were accustomed to reckon their time
and feasts by weeks or sabbaths. The week of days
was from one seventh or sabbath day to another. The
week of years was from one seventh or sabbatical year
to another; in the seventh, or sabbatical year, they
neither sowed their fields nor pruned their vineyards;
it was a sabbath of rest unto the land.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> In the regulation
of the year of Jubilee, they were commanded to
number "seven sabbaths of years, seven times seven
years, and the space of the seven sabbaths of years
shall be to thee forty and nine years."<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> We therefore
only follow the Mosaic rule, (to which Moses' disciples
cannot object,) if we consider these seven weeks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
and three score and two weeks, as seven times sixty-nine,
or four hundred and eighty-three years, which
should be between "the going forth of the commandment
to restore and build Jerusalem unto the Messiah,
the Prince." There were four distinct decrees or commandments
granted by the kings of Persia, in favour
of the Jews, who came under the dominion of that
empire by its conquest of Babylon. This was the
epoch of Daniel's vision. No sooner had Cyrus
obtained possession of Chaldea, than he issued a
decree allowing the Jews to quit the land of their
captivity, and repair to Judea to build the temple of
the Lord. He also restored to them the vessels and
treasures which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the
temple built by Solomon. On the grant of this
decree,<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> five hundred and thirty-six years before
Christ, many of the Jews returned to their own land,
and laid the foundation of the temple; but they were
hindered in the building of it by their several enemies,
who were supported in their opposition by Artaxerxes,
the successor of Cyrus. But when Darius
Hystaspes ascended the throne of Persia, he issued a
decree<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> five hundred and nineteen years before Christ,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
forbidding the enemies of the Jews to interrupt the
building of the temple, and further commanded that
materials requisite for the work, and the animals,
oil, and wine for the sacrifices, should be supplied
at his (the king's) cost. The third decree was granted
to Ezra, the scribe, four hundred and sixty-seven
years before Christ, by Artaxerxes Longimanus, in
the seventh year of his reign, by which he bestowed
great favours upon the Jews,<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> appointing Ezra Governor
of Judea. He permitted all the Jews to return
to Jerusalem, and commanded his treasurers beyond
the river, to supply Ezra with such things as he needed
for the house of his God, even to an hundred talents
of silver, an hundred measures of wheat, an hundred
baths of wine, and an hundred baths of oil. The king
and his princes presented much silver and gold, and
many vessels, and ordered that what else might be required
for the house of God, should be supplied from
the king's treasury. This is not the same Artaxerxes
who listened to the slanderous reports of the enemies
of the Jews, and stopped the building of their temple;
but Artaxerxes, surnamed Longimanus, supposed to
be the person styled Ahasuerus, in the book of Esther,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
whose attachment to his Israelitish consort may account
for the distinguished favours he conferred on the
people of her nation. We find the queen was present
when Nehemiah presented his petition, which was
the second decree granted by this monarch, and was
the fourth and last decree, being granted in the twentieth
year of his reign, and four hundred and fifty-four
years before Christ.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> This was the most efficient
decree, for by it Jerusalem and its walls were built.
The high resolves of the court of Heaven were revealed;
Daniel was made "to know and understand that
from the going forth of the commandment to restore
and build Jerusalem, <em>unto</em> the Messiah, the prince,
shall be seven weeks, and three score and two weeks,
being sixty nine weeks, or four hundred and eighty-three
years. From the last, or fourth, decree to
the birth of Christ, (vide Rollin, volume 8, page
265,) is four hundred and fifty-four years, to which
we add twenty-nine years (the age at about which
Christ entered on his public ministry);<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> these united,
make the exact period of sixty-nine weeks, or four
hundred and eighty-three years. Daniel also declares
that "seventy weeks (or four hundred and ninety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
years) are determined upon thy people and upon thy
holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an
end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity,
and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal
up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most
Holy." We find between the seventy weeks, or four
hundred and ninety years, and the sixty-nine weeks,
or four hundred and eighty-three years, a difference
of one week, or seven years, which is the week evidently
alluded to in the twenty-seventh verse of this
chapter, in which "he shall confirm the covenant with
many for one week, &amp;c." From the period of Christ's
first entry into the ministry, and the calling of his
apostles, until his crucifixion, were three and a half
years, and, for three and a half years after that event,
his apostles continued to minister amongst the Jews.
This makes a period of seven years, (or one prophetic
week,) in the midst of which the Messiah was cut off,
and "the sacrifice and oblation" virtually ceased.
The correspondence is exact: Jesus, the Messiah, not
only entered on his public ministry at the very period
pointed out ages before, but was actually cut off in
the midst of the week, as was expressly foretold.
These predictions of the Prince Messiah are peculiarly
striking. The time for his appearance is marked, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
the particular objects he should effect on his coming,
are described with such minuteness, as scarcely to
admit of the possibility of mistaking his person. The
grand features of his mission were so strongly exhibited,
that it was morally impossible the Messiah
should appear and not be recognised. Prejudice must
have blinded the eye of that mind which does not, on
comparing the whole of the New Testament with this
prophecy, acknowledge Jesus of Nazareth to be the
Messiah. It bears the stamp of divine prescience:
none but the omniscient God could have given his
features with such clearness so many ages before.
This portrait of the Messiah, which bears so exact a
resemblance to Jesus, was in the possession of the
Jews, at least five hundred years before that glorious
person was exhibited to the world, a God incarnate.</p>

<p>Jesus declares himself to be the long promised
Messiah&mdash;his claim rests on no slight or doubtful
evidence&mdash;he came at the very precise time it was
foretold the Messiah should appear to the people and
the holy city. Christ's ministry was among the people
of the Jews&mdash;Judea was the land of his nativity&mdash;the
scene of his labours&mdash;the witness of his miracles&mdash;he
was born at Bethlehem, near Jerusalem, and
crucified just "without the gate" of the holy city.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
On Calvary "he finished the transgressions, and made
an end of sin, and make reconciliation for iniquity."
There the God-man, Christ Jesus, offered up his life
a ransom for the guilty&mdash;there the surety of the Church
paid the full price for her redemption, and made
peace by the blood of his cross&mdash;there "he suffered
the just for the unjust to bring sinners unto God."
He took away "the hand-writing of ordinances that
was against us, taking them out of the way by nailing
them to the cross"&mdash;there he removed the iniquity
of the land in one day, and so completely "finished
the transgression," by suffering the punishment due
for his people's sins, that when they are "sought for
they shall not be found"&mdash;there he paid the full price
of their redemption, he cancelled the bond, and made
peace and reconciliation with offended justice. He
"brought in an everlasting righteousness, and not only
suffered the penalty due for their transgressions of
God's law, 'which is holy, just, and good,' but, as
the head of the Church, he obeyed all the precepts of
the moral law; which he exalted and made honourable.
Perfect was the obedience wrought out&mdash;complete
was the righteousness brought in by the incarnate
Deity, the Lord our righteousness, which is from everlasting
to everlasting "unto all and upon all that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
believe, for there is no difference." Amidst the awful
gloom on Calvary's mount, was heard the cry "it
is finished!" It was the conqueror's shout&mdash;victory
was achieved&mdash;Satan was vanquished&mdash;the sting of
death was taken away&mdash;the power of the grave destroyed&mdash;the
conflict was over&mdash;the ransom paid&mdash;the
captives of the mighty delivered&mdash;the law was honoured&mdash;justice
satisfied&mdash;God glorified&mdash;Heaven
opened&mdash;man redeemed&mdash;and hell vanquished. That
was the glorious event which types were intended to exhibit,
and prophets were commissioned to proclaim. The
appointed time of the vision was arrived&mdash;it had long
tarried, but it was accomplished. The chain of
prophecy was complete&mdash;the vision was sealed<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>&mdash;and
the most holy anointed. The God-man, Christ
Jesus, anointed by his Father king and priest of
Zion, then exchanged his thorny crown for the royal
diadem&mdash;then left the sorrows of earth for the glories
of his mediatorial throne, which no enemy can touch&mdash;their
opposition is vain&mdash;he that sitteth upon the
circle of the heavens, will laugh them to scorn.
Happy are they who have for their king and priest,
<em>him</em> whose kingdom is eternal, and priesthood unchangeable&mdash;who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
look to the Redeemer of Israel as the
rock of their salvation, and crown the most holy, Lord
of all. "Happy are the people that are in such a case,
yea, blessed are the people whose God is the Lord."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER LXIV.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>And after three score and two weeks shall Messiah be cut
off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that
shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the
end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war
desolations are determined.&mdash;Daniel ix. 26.</p></blockquote>


<p>This vision of Daniel appears involved in considerable
obscurity, by the diversity of time alluded to
in the several parts of the prophecy, and renders it
difficult to prove its exact accomplishment. But we
hope we have shown in the preceding part, that it
does not militate against "the truth as it is in
Jesus," it rather tends to strengthen the testimony,
by affording an additional opportunity of proving, from
sacred and profane history, the fulfilment of the
great event. The proof of its accomplishment does
not rest on the insulated fact, but is established by a
chain of evidence, derived from the annals of nations.
For, whichever of the decrees we take, it is clear from
ancient chronology, that the period alluded to is passed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
and the Messiah did appear not far from the time
named by any decree. As we have attempted to
prove the fulfilment of the first part of the prophetic
vision, it may not be improper if we now endeavour
to show that the remaining part of this interesting
prophecy has also been accomplished.</p>

<p>"After threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be
cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the
prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the
sanctuary." "Secret things belong unto God; but
things that are revealed, to you and your children."
We cannot ascertain to a certainty when the seventy-two
weeks commence, but it is evident they terminate
at the cutting off of the Messiah. From the words
"And the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto
the end of the war desolations are determined," it
appears, also, to allude to the destruction of the city,
previous to which event the Messiah should be cut
off. We hope we shall not offer any violence to the
words, if we give them this interpretation. The destruction
of Jerusalem is not the only event alluded
to in this interesting prophecy; there is one of paramount
importance to the ruin of Salem's palaces,
though that involved the fate of Judah's sons. On
the other momentous fact hang the highest interests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
of Jew and Gentile, bond and free, past, present, and
future generations; not only the happiness of earth,
but much of the glory of heaven, depends on its accomplishment.
Without it no sweet song of "Salvation
to God and the Lamb," would have echoed amidst the
heavenly hills, none of the race of Adam would be
seen worshipping before the presence of Jehovah with
the angels of light; those melodious hymns of redemption,
now chaunted by ten thousand times ten
thousand glorified Saints, had not been heard but for
the vicarious sacrifice of the Son of God,<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> who not
only covenanted, but did actually lay down his life
a ransom for sinners. When Jesus, the Christ of
God, the Prince Messiah, appeared on earth, it was
not simply to set the children of men an example of
piety and virtue; we ardently admire his glorious
example, and consider his followers bound to imitate
the bright pattern he has left them; yet we dare not
believe that <em>that</em> was the only object he designed to
accomplish when he visited our world.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> No, he came
as the federal Head, the Representative and Surety
of his people.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> He was "cut off from the land of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
the living," by a violent and cruel death; yet not for
himself, not for any sin of his own,<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> nor purposely to
set us a pattern of patience and resignation; but to
discharge the debt of sin, he had covenanted to cancel
on man's account. Jehovah executed towards him
the severest justice, and permitted his crucifiers to
exercise the blackest ingratitude, and most inhuman
cruelty. "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou who killest
the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee,
how often would the Lord have gathered thee under his
protecting care as a hen gathereth her chickens under
her wings, but ye would not." Thy awful doom was
sealed when thou didst reject the authority, and persecute
unto death Jesus the Messiah, thy prophet and benefactor,
thy God and King. The thought of thy approaching
misery drew tears from the eyes, and
groans from the heart, of Incarnate Deity; yet thy
children beheld, with feelings of triumphant scorn, the
sorrows and sufferings their wanton cruelty inflicted
on the Holy Jesus. But heaven marked the impious
deed.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> The blood of Jesus, of prophets, of apostles,
and of martyrs, called for vengeance on thy guilty
land; the cry was heard, justice remembered thy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
black catalogue of crimes, the King of heaven beheld
the insult offered to his beloved Son, and Jehovah
arose to punish thy rejection of Jesus the Messiah,
whom "ye would not have to reign over you." The
crimes of Jerusalem were of the blackest and most
awful character, and her punishment was tremendously
dreadful.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> The Israelites, once the peculiar
favourites of Heaven<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>&mdash;nursed in the lap of plenty,
instructed in the oracles of God&mdash;blessed with the
temple of Jehovah&mdash;taught to adore the God of truth
whom their forefathers worshipped; this people, who
once had the Lord for their Law-giver and King,<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
were compelled to bow beneath the oppressive power of
arbitrary despots&mdash;the law of truth was exchanged for
the tyrant's mandate&mdash;equity and justice were banished
the walls of Salem, and despotism, oppression, blasphemy,
and pride, reigned within that devoted, miserable,
city. Anarchy and confusion ruled that senate and
sanctuary, once as gloriously "distinguished from the
rest of the world by the purity of its government, as
by the richness and elegance of its buildings. Jerusalem
was devoted to destruction, and she sunk beneath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
the accumulated horrors of war, famine, fire, and pestilence.
Internal faction and a foreign foe reduced that
beauteous city and magnificent sanctuary, to a heap of
ruins. The temple fell&mdash;not all the commands, promises,
or threats of Titus, could save that splendid edifice
from destruction; the people of the prince, regardless
of their general's orders, helped to complete the work
of desolation;&mdash;but prophecy was fulfilled, Jerusalem
was overwhelmed with the flood of divine vengeance,
and desolation prevailed even unto the end of the war.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER LXV.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week;
and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and
the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations
he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation,
and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.&mdash;Daniel
ix. 27.</p></blockquote>


<p>Some writers consider this verse prophetical of the
desolate state of Jerusalem under Antiochus Epiphanes,
that sacrilegious monarch who impiously profaned
the sanctuary of the God of Israel. By him
the temple was ransacked and despoiled of its holy
vessels; its golden ornaments pulled off; its hidden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
treasures seized; and an unclean animal offered on
the altar of burnt-offerings. Thus did this impious
Syrian king dare profane the altar and temple dedicated
to Jehovah. Neither was this all; Jerusalem
again felt the force of his horrid cruelty and profaneness;
men, women, and children, were either slain or
taken captive; and the houses and city walls were
destroyed. The Jews were not allowed to offer burnt
offerings or sacrifices to the God of Israel&mdash;circumcision
was forbidden&mdash;they were required to profane
the Sabbath, and eat the flesh of swine, and other
beasts forbidden by their law<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>&mdash;the sanctuary dedicated
to Jehovah was called the temple of Jupiter
Olympius, and his image set up on the altar&mdash;idol
temples and altars were erected throughout all their
cities&mdash;and the Holy Scriptures destroyed whenever
they were met with&mdash;and death was the fate of those
who read the word of the Lord. The most horrid and
brutal cruelties were inflicted on such as chose to
obey God, rather than this Syrian monster. Jerusalem
was overspread by his abominations; desolation
was indeed poured out "upon the desolate" when
Antiochus Epiphanes held the blood stained sceptre,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
emblem of satanic power. Yet, closely as these circumstances
resemble the description given by the
prophet's vision, we cannot think it is the event alluded
to in this prophecy. Daniel, in the three preceding
verses, speaks of the Messiah, and the final destruction
of the city and sanctuary: by Antiochus the temple
certainly was <em>not</em> destroyed. In the eleventh chapter
there appears a striking prophecy of the events which
happened in Jerusalem during the dominion of the
Syrian tyrant, but we cannot think he is alluded to in
any part of the ninth chapter. The first clause of
this verse, "He shall confirm the covenant with
many," cannot refer to Antiochus, but alludes to the
same glorious person mentioned in the preceding
verses. The latter part of this verse may with propriety
be considered as a continuance of the prophecy of
Jerusalem's final destruction, as it occurred under
Titus. To Jesus the Messiah we direct our eyes.
The one week, or the midst of the week, (seven years
half expired,) alludes to the time of his Public Ministry,
which was three years and a half; during which
period he declared, the design of his mission was to confirm
the well-ordered covenant of redemption and peace,
which was drawn up in the counsels of eternity&mdash;sealed
on earth with the blood of the Incarnate God&mdash;signed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
in the presence of Jehovah, angels, men, and
devils&mdash;registered in the court of Heaven&mdash;and proclaimed
good and valid by the resurrection of Jesus from
the dead, and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> It is
true, the sacrifices and oblations of the temple service
did not cease immediately on the death of Christ,
they were continued some little time after that event;
but they became unnecessary, they had lost their
value, and were but idle ceremonies and useless rights,
when the thing signified was accomplished. At best,
they were only types of the Lamb of God, the blood of
that one great sacrifice, which alone "cleanseth from
all sin." "It is not possible for the blood of bulls or
goats to take away sin." No, the sacrifices and
ceremonies of the Mosaic economy were only efficacious
so far as Christ, the substance, was viewed
through the shadow.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> In less than forty years after
the death of Christ, the sacrifices and oblations ceased,
for the temple was demolished. A spot so deeply
stained with crime, needed the fire of divine vengeance
to consume it from the face of the earth: it was
erected for the worship of the God of Israel, but was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
turned into the seat of iniquity and profaneness. The
horrid enormities observed in the temple of Juggernaut
scarcely surpassed the impious practices exercised
within the Jewish sanctuary. When Titus, the Roman
general, approached the walls of the city, it
more resembled the court of Mars and Bacchus, than
the temple of Jehovah; the drunkard's voice&mdash;the
clash of arms&mdash;the shouts of the victor&mdash;the cries of
the vanquished&mdash;and the groans of the dying, echoed
through that magnificent pile; human blood flowed
in its courts, and sprinkled its altars and its walls.
Jerusalem was a scene of slaughter; but it was not a
war to support the glorious cause of freedom; nor
were they fighting to repel the foreign foe, or shedding
their blood to defend their beloved homes, and the
still dearer objects of affection, around which the
warm heart clings with fondest thought amidst the
scene of danger and of death, and for whose preservation
the weakest arm grows desperate, and the
feeblest mind resolves to conquer or to die. But theirs
was no such glorious contest; no&mdash;civil war had reared
her hydra head; the horrid yell of intestine discord
rang through Salem's courts, and echoed round her
walls; that infernal power bursts the bands of brotherhood,
severs the closest ties, dissolves the strongest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
link of union, and makes the man a monster. The
sword of her own sons deluged Jerusalem with Jewish
blood; the fire which destroyed her houses was kindled
by her own children; death and destruction
reigned through all her palaces; the city groaned
beneath a three-fold faction, when the Roman legions
approached her walls to complete the horrid scene of
slaughter. The temple was the head-quarters of
Eleazar and the Zealots; they had in their possession
the stores of first fruits and offerings, and were frequently
in a state of intoxication; but when not
drunken with wine, they thirsted for the blood of their
countrymen, and issued from their strong hold, to
assault John and his party, who lay intrenched in the
out-works of the temple. The ruin of Jerusalem is
attributed to the horrid enormities of the Zealot faction:
surely that was the summit of wickedness, when
the priests sold themselves to work iniquity, and the
temple of the Lord was the seat of their crimes. That
was "the overspreading of abomination," and it
continued until the sanctuary was consumed, and
"ruin was poured upon the desolators." It was the
iniquitous practices of the Jews, rather than the
Roman eagle, which profaned the courts of the Lord's
House: the conquerors did not plant their standard to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
insult, but with a wish to preserve, the temple from
total ruin and destruction.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXVI.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle;
and the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the
women ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity,
and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from
the city.&mdash;Zechariah xiv. 2.</p></blockquote>


<p>Imperial Rome, to whom the world once bowed,
and whose power could command armies from "all
nations," had conquered Judea, and received from
her the yearly tribute of her subjection:<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> but, through
the oppression of the Roman governors, and the madness
of the people, the standard of revolt was planted,
and the Jews attempted to break their yoke of bondage.
The Roman legions, inured to war, and accustomed
to the shout of victory, hastened to subdue the
rebellious Israelites: they passed from city to city, and
from province to province; slaughter and death marked
their course; the strife was desperate; the conflict
bloody; the Jews fought like men determined to conquer
or to die: two hundred and forty-seven thousand seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
hundred were slain before their provinces were subjugated,
and an immense number made prisoners:
amongst whom was Josephus, the historian of the war,
who was governor of the two Galilees, and who defended
them with skill and bravery. The Romans, having
conquered the provinces, approached to assault Jerusalem,
which was then a dreadful scene. The
sound of war was heard through all her gates; regardless
of the approaching foe, the Jews had turned their
arms against each other; three several factions were
busily engaged in the work of slaughter and destruction.
Eleazar and the Zealots seized the temple;
John of Gischala and his followers occupied its
out-works; and Simon, the son of Gorias, possessed
the whole of the lower, and a great part of the
upper, town. Jerusalem was built on two hills;
the highest, on which stood the temple, was called
the upper town, and the other the lower: between
these lay a valley covered with houses; the suburbs
of the city were extensive, and encircled by a wall;
two other walls also surrounded Jerusalem, the interior
one of remarkable strength. Neither of the three
factious parties had any just claim to supremacy or
power, though all contended for dominion, and fought
for plunder. The Zealots were the smallest party,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
but, from their situation, possessed the advantage:
they sallied from their strong holds to attack John,
who seized every opportunity of assaulting Simon;
thus John maintained a double war, and was often
obliged to divide his forces, being attacked by Eleazar
and Simon at the same time. In these furious contests,
no age or sex was spared; the slaughter was
dreadful. When either party was repelled, the other
set fire to the building, without any distinction. Regardless
of their contents, they consumed granaries
and store-houses, which contained a stock of corn
and other necessaries of life, sufficient to maintain the
inhabitants during a siege of many years; but nearly
the whole was burnt, and this circumstance made
way for a calamity more horrid than even war itself.
Famine soon showed her meagre form, and all classes
felt the dreadful effects of a scarcity of food. Such
was the miserable state of Jerusalem when the Roman
general Titus (son of the reigning emperor, Vespasian,)
prepared to attack the city. The sight of a
powerful foreign foe at their gates, with all the artillery
of war, could not quell the factions within; it is true,
when closely pressed by the Romans, the three parties
joined to repel the common enemy, but no sooner had
they breathing time, than the spirit of contention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
arose, and they resumed the slaughter of each other:
thus they maintained a fierce contest with the
besiegers, and, at the same time, seized every opportunity
of destroying each other. The misery of the
city was soon beyond precedent, from the dreadful
effects of famine, the price of provisions became exorbitant,
and, when no longer offered for sale, the
houses were entered and searched, and the wretched
owners tortured till they confessed where the slender
pittance was concealed; at length the distress became
so great, that persons parted with the whole of their
property to obtain a bushel of wheat, which they eat
before it could be baked, or even ground; and happy
was he who could catch a morsel of meat, half
roasted, half raw, from the fire. No kind of cruelty
was omitted in search of food: at length their sufferings
were so severe, that the wretched inhabitants were
necessitated to search the vaults and sinks for sustenance,
and even fed on articles too offensive to be
named. The ties of nature and humanity were forgotten,
the wife seized the food from her husband, the
child from the parent, and even the mother from her
infant.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> The excruciating pain of famine so far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
overpowered the tenderest and finest affections in
nature, that a woman, descended from a rich and
respectable family, even killed, boiled, and ate, her
own child, a son in all the artless and endearing simplicity
of infancy! Well may the British mother
tremble at the horrid sound, and pity the wretched
Israelitish female, thus sunk below the brute. Pestilence
now stalked abroad, for the air was tainted by the
dead: though no less than six hundred thousand dead
bodies were carried out of the city during the time
Titus encamped before the walls, yet there was an
incredible number who had no friends to bury them,
and their bodies were enclosed in large buildings, or
laid in heaps in the open air. "O Jerusalem, thou
didst drink at the hand of the Lord the cup of his fury,
thou hast drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling,
and wrung them out" even desolation, destruction,
famine and sword, "thy houses rifled, thy women
ravished" by Jewish ruffians, and the city at length
taken by the Roman general. Titus had again and
again offered the Jews honourable terms of capitulation;
but they rejected all his overtures with proud
disdain, and when his soldiers took the city, exasperated
at the hardships they had endured, they spared
neither sex, age, or rank. Sword and fire destroyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
Jerusalem and her children, and closed this horrid
war, in which one million one hundred thousand Jews
were slain, and ninety-seven thousand made prisoners.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXVII.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>The Lord shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the
end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flieth; a nation whose
tongue thou shalt not understand; a nation of fierce countenance,
which shall not regard the person of the old, nor show
favour to the young.&mdash;Deut. xxviii. 49, 50.</p>

<p>And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept
over it, saying, if thou hadst known, even thou, at least in
this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but
now they are hid from thine eyes. For the days shall come
upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee,
and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side, and
shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within
thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another;
because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.&mdash;Luke
xix. 41-44.</p></blockquote>


<p>Judea was not conquered by the neighbouring
Asiatic states, but by the Roman, Europeans of a
"fierce and warlike countenance," who knew not the
Jewish language, and regarded not "the persons of
the old, nor showed favour to the young." It will
not be difficult to trace the Roman soldiers in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
eloquently descriptive character. No nation excelled
them in their military prowess, or in the rapidity of
their conquests. In comparatively a very short period
of time, they extended their empire over all the then
civilised part of the globe. The insignia of their
legions was not more descriptive of their valour, than
of the unexampled rapidity of their movements. The
celebrated motto of C&#230;sar, "I came, I saw, I conquered,"
was neither of a doubtful, or boasting, character.
Their career was indeed "as swift as the
eagle flieth." No nation or people did long withstand
the fierceness of their attacks, or the persevering
energy of their generals. In their triumphs over their
enemies, they frequently displayed a ferocity happily
unknown in modern warfare. The most distinguished
of their captives, without regard to age or sex, were
dragged in triumph, amidst the shouts of the conquerors,
and the insults of the rabble. Often, when
exasperated by the protracted defence of a brave
people struggling for their existence, instead of respecting
such patriotic efforts, they inflicted the most
horrid barbarities upon the unresisting and unhappy
objects of their vengeance; and a slaughter, indiscriminating
in its fury, and dreadful in its results,
marked the blood-stained progress of the licentious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
soldiery, who "regarded not the person of the old,
nor showed favour to the young." History informs
us, that the Romans, under Titus and Vespasian,
after a protracted siege, unparalleled in horror, and
sanguinary beyond example, at length became masters
of this once-favoured spot; and if we compare the
predictions of Christ with the events which occurred,
and followed at the taking of this devoted city, we shall
be struck with the coincidence of the declaration, and
its awful fulfilment.</p>

<p>His foreknowledge of the dreadful calamities which
should precede and accompany the destruction of Jerusalem,
caused our blessed Saviour, when he beheld
the city, to weep over it: and, surely, if this once-favoured
race had then known the day of its visitation,
the Lord would have turned from his fierce anger:
but these things "were hid from their eyes." Having
rejected the Lord of Glory, they were given over to
judicial blindness, and the Lord brought upon them
"a nation from afar" to execute his vengeance.
Jerusalem was "trodden down by the Gentiles,"
and there was "great distress upon the land, and
wrath upon the people." The sword and the spear from
without, and famine and pestilence and civil discord
within, were indeed unto them "the beginning of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
sorrows." The predicted day was now come, when
their "enemies should cast a trench about them,
and compass them round, and keep them in on every
side." Their walls of strength, their beautiful palaces,
and their magnificent temple, were laid "even
with the ground." Not "one stone was left upon
another" that was not thrown down; and all the
princes and the nobles, the ruler and the ruled, the
priest and the people, and "the children within thee,"
either "fell by the edge of the sword," or were "led
away captive into all nations," for there was "great
distress in the land, and wrath upon the people."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXVIII.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field,
and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the
house as the high places of the forest.&mdash;Micah iii. 12.</p></blockquote>


<p>"Walk about Zion, and go round about her,
tell the towers thereof, mark ye well her bulwarks,
consider her palaces," are they still "beautiful for
situation?" Is Jerusalem yet the "joy of the whole
earth?" Within "her walls peace once reigned,
and prosperity within her palaces." But how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
changed the spot! desolation and dismay reign in
undisturbed possession, where elegance and art
displayed their richest and most curious productions.
Jerusalem is fallen&mdash;war destroyed her palaces, and
levelled her temple&mdash;the fire which consumed that
magnificent city was kindled by the hand of civil
discord&mdash;the desolating element that blazed with
awful glare, amidst the splendid sanctuary, was first
lit by Jewish hands&mdash;and the enfuriated Roman
soldiers applied the torch, which ultimately destroyed
the temple of Jehovah. The Jews having burnt the
greater part of the galleries around the temple, and
the Roman soldiers set fire to the remainder, Titus
commanded his troops to extinguish the flames; but
no sooner were his orders executed than a Roman
soldier threw a fire-brand into the temple, and the interior
was instantly in a blaze; the flames spread with
rapidity, and not all the commands, threatenings, or
entreaties, of the Roman general, and his officers, were
effectual to preserve the building. Whilst some were
endeavouring to check the furious element, others set
fire to several of the door-posts; the scene was dreadful;
the Jews were filled with astonishment and
horror, and their conquerors with fury. Amidst the
crackling of the fire were heard the shouts of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
victors, and the cries of the vanquished; the shrieks
of the wounded, and the groans of the dying. The
ground on every side was strewed with dead; while
the courts flowed with Jewish blood, the fire raged
above; the conflagration was awful, and the massacre
dreadful.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> Jerusalem and its walls were destroyed,
the temple levelled, and the Jews conquered, in the
second year of the reign of Vespasian, on the same
month and day as Nebuchadnezzar destroyed the
former city and temple. The last temple, once celebrated
for its magnificence, is now no more. That
building which, by the solidity of its construction,
seemed to defy the mouldering hand of time, soon
became a heap of ruins, and "the mountain of the
house as the high places of the forest."<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> Titus, before
he withdrew his troops, commanded them to
reduce the city and temple to a level with the ground,
and they left not "one stone upon another," to mark
the spot where the temple stood. So strictly was
this order executed, that the demolished city scarcely
appeared to have been the residence of human creatures.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
Only three strong towers remained of the
once magnificent Jerusalem, and they were left to
exhibit to future times the skill and power of the
Roman troops, in becoming possessed of a place so
strongly fortified by nature and art. Josephus and
other Jews attribute the unparalleled calamities of
their country-men, and the destruction of the temple,
to the signal vengeance of heaven, inflicted to punish
that deluded people for their cruelty and injustice to
James the just, the brother of Jesus, who is called
Christ: but a believer of the New Testament <em>must</em>
consider that <em>they</em> were punished for their rejection
and crucifixion of Jesus Christ himself, the Messiah of
Israel, and Son of God; it was for <em>that</em> cause "Zion
was plowed as a field; Jerusalem became a heap of
ruins, and the mountain of the house as the high
places of the forest."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER LXIX.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling
and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel,
for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.&mdash;Isaiah
viii. 14.</p></blockquote>


<p>These words are not prophetical of the person of
the Messiah, yet they describe, in striking language,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
the effects that would follow his appearance and
ministry upon earth. They foretel the opposition and
enmity that would arise, in the minds of the Jewish
nation, to the Christ of God. If the whole Israelitish
race had gladly hailed Jesus as their Messiah,
and if all, to whom the Gospel has been proclaimed,
from its first promulgation down to the present hour;
if all these countless multitudes, had cordially embraced
the faith of Christ, it could not have proved
a more decisive evidence of "the truth as it is
in Jesus," than is afforded by the Jews in their rejection
of Christ as the Messiah. Thereby the prophecies
of God are fulfilled concerning <em>him</em>, who, though set
for a sanctuary, became "a stumbling block, and rock
of offence," to the house of Israel, "and a gin and a
snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem." The Jews
were not a little vain of the glorious pre-eminence
their nation once sustained amidst the kingdoms of
the world, on account of the wondrous works, which
the Lord of Hosts had wrought for them, by "his
mighty hand, and outstretched arm." Their religious
distinctions and ceremonies had also tended to feed
their pride, and nourish their haughty contempt, for
the other nations of the earth. Their long promised
Messiah was not forgotten by them. In his reign,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
their lively imaginations had blended all the splendid
conquests and dazzling magnificence of regal power.
Theirs was a tone of mind but ill-suited to bow before
the despised Man of Nazareth; to embrace the commands,
and follow as a master, one so poor, that
"he had not where to lay his head." When we
consider the natural pride of the human heart, as
joined with the national pride of the Jewish people,
we may cease to wonder at their rejection of Jesus.
They could not stoop to acknowledge even the Son
of God as their ruler, when offered to them void
of the purple robe and golden sceptre. They could
not swear allegiance to Zion's King, when they saw
neither his royal pavilion, nor marshalled troops.
They could not bow before one born in a stable, though
Angels had descended to proclaim his glorious advent.
What wonder, if the eye by gazing so long and frequently
on the dazzling splendour they were wont to
attach to the Messiah's reign, could not perceive the
fainter rays of glory that glimmered around the
retired path of the Man of Nazareth; they were
offended at the absence of all temporal splendour in
his person; the Cross of Christ proved a stumbling
block and rock of offence. The Jews rejected, as
unfit for their-building, "the precious corner stone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
which the Lord God had lain in Zion, as a sure
foundation." They could not admit the Carpenter's
Son to be the head of God's Church, nor acknowledge
the Man, untaught in the schools of worldly science,
to be the prophet of God's people. Neither "has
the offence of the cross yet ceased;" multitudes
still despise and reject the Christ of God; they are
ashamed to own allegiance to Jesus of Nazareth; they
blush to acknowledge, as their Lord and Master, him
who died upon the accursed tree; they dislike to be
thought one of his real followers, and hate the humiliating
and self-denying commands he enjoins on his
disciples. They prefer building their hopes for eternity
on the sandy foundation of human merit, rather than
on the blood and righteousness of Jesus. But if we
refuse to rest on Christ, that "sure foundation God has
laid in Zion," all other grounds of hope will prove a
treacherous rest, from which the floods of divine
justice will sweep us to the dark abyss of wo. God
has declared that "other foundation can no man lay,
than is laid, which is Christ Jesus." Yet how little
anxiety is evinced on a subject of such immense importance!
How few are concerned to build their
hopes for eternity, on Christ, the Rock of Ages, that
precious corner stone; that tried stone; tried by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
countless myriads of happy saints, now in glory, who
found him faithful to save from the overwhelming
surge. Must not he, who paid the full price of a
soul, know its worth? and has he not declared, that
it will profit us little "to gain the whole world and
lose our own soul?" One soul is of more real value
than this world, with all its boasted riches and glories.
The day is coming when "the heavens shall
depart as a scroll, the elements melt with fervent
heat," and this world, so loved and caressed by its
votaries will be utterly consumed by the fire of divine
vengeance. But the soul of every individual must
exist for ever, either in eternal happiness or misery.
Yet how is the method of man's reconciliation with
God slighted? How is that glorious scheme of
redemption, by the death of Christ, despised by the
great majority of those to whom it is published. Do
angels turn from the lofty pursuits and glories of
the heavenly world, to pry into the mysteries of the
cross; and shall man, for whose benefit it was contrived
and accomplished, remain stupidly insensible
to its excellence and glory, carelessly indifferent
whether or not he partake of the blessing?</p>

<p>Are we not taught in the case of our first parents,
the absolute necessity there is for our knowing and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
receiving Christ? Was it not on the evening of the
same day, in which they brake through the fence of
God's command, that he was graciously pleased to
discover to them his plan of reconciliation in the
promised seed? And why so soon after their transgression?
but that the knowledge of it was necessary to
their salvation. Shall that scheme of Redemption,
which required the depths of divine wisdom to
contrive, and the extent of divine love to
execute, be despised and rejected by man, as unworthy
his acceptance? By man, that worm of the
earth, that creature of a day, so insignificant amidst
the stupendous works of God, that if he were annihilated,
he would scarcely be missed amid the boundless
immensity of space. Awful is the state of the Gentile
or the Jew who "hath trodden under foot the
Son of God, and counted the blood of the covenant
an unholy thing."</p>

<p>The Jews, where are they? or rather, where are
they not? To what part of the world can we turn,
without beholding some of the tribe of Israel. They
dwell in every land, but have none they can call their
own? They have lost their power, but preserved their
national features and manners. Wanderers on the face
of the globe for nearly eighteen hundred years, they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
not assimilated with any people. What other nation
has so long preserved a distinction? Where are the
Britons, Romans, Saxons, Normans, ancient inhabitants
of our Isle? They are all blended in the
English. The Jews, though dwelling in every country,
are still an unmixed people, yet that very distinction
exposes them to persecution and scorn. The
dispersion of the Jews is but a small part of their
calamities. The Hebrews are a despised and persecuted
race, compelled to endure, without the hope
of redress, indignities the most revolting&mdash;barbarities
the most cruel&mdash;insults the most degrading&mdash;losses
the most severe. And this not merely from one
nation, but nearly the whole world has wreaked its
vengeance on this unhappy people. Even the most
civilised and polished nations have stooped to load the
Jews with obloquy and scorn; many and grievous
are the disabilities to which they are subject. Yes,
Jehovah has executed his threatened punishment upon
this unhappy people, for their rejection of the Messiah.
"He has scattered them among all people from
one end of the earth even unto the other." "Their
plagues have been wonderful, even great plagues, and
of long continuance." They are become "an astonishment,
a proverb, and by-word among all nations."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>All the prophecies of the Messiah which we possess,
were handed down to us from the Jews. The Hebrew
and Greek versions of the Old Testament were in
their possession long before the gospel era. Its latest
prophecy was at least four hundred and thirty years
before the angel's shout was heard, "Glory to God
in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward
men." Nor do the Jews attempt to deny that Jesus
of Nazareth appeared at the time related by the Evangelists.
Josephus, the Jewish historian, in his antiquities
of that nation, (book the 18th,) relates:&mdash;"About
this period, (referring to the reign of Tiberius
C&#230;sar,) there arose to notice one Jesus, a man of
consummate wisdom, <em>if, indeed, he may be deemed
a man</em>. He was eminently celebrated for his power
of working miracles; and they who were curious and
desirous to learn the truth, flocked to him in abundance.
He was followed by immense numbers of
people, as well Jews as Gentiles. This was that
Christ, whom the princes and great men of our
nation accused. He was delivered up to the cross by
Pontius Pilate; notwithstanding which, those who
originally adhered to him, never forsook him. On
the third day after his crucifixion he was seen alive,
agreeably to the predictions of several prophets: he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
wrought a great number of marvellous acts; and
there remain, even to this day, a sect of people who
bear the name of Christians, who acknowledge this
Christ for their head." This honourable testimony is
from an enemy&mdash;a Jew, whose writings were held in
high estimation by his nation. Christ "came into
his own nation, but they received him not." No
evidence, however bright or clear, was sufficient to
convince men so blinded by prejudice. Warned,
invited, and threatened, still they persisted in rejecting
the Messiah, because he did not assume the
warrior's sword, or mount the throne of Judah. Should
we not feel more disposed to pity and reclaim, that
insult and oppress, this deluded people? Have they
no claim to our gratitude? To "them were committed
the Oracles of God," which we now enjoy.
The prophets and apostles were all Jews; and from
them, "according to the flesh, Christ came, who is over
all, God blessed for evermore." It is recorded, by
ecclesiastical writers, that several of Christ's own
disciples and apostles&mdash;Simon Peter, Simon Zelotes,
James the son of Zebedee, Joseph of Arimathea,
Aristobulus, and St. Paul himself, preached the
gospel to this nation. If this, indeed, be correct, their
nation has peculiar claims to our regard, for the services<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
of their ancestors. Certainly, the Romans
were instructed in Christianity by Paul and other
Jews; and, in the first century, the Roman legions,
and the standard of the gospel of Christ, were planted
on Albion's coast.</p>

<p>The Jews, though scattered and persecuted, are
not destroyed; they are preserved monuments of the
divine veracity. O, may we take warning from their
awful fate! "Because of unbelief <em>they</em> were broken
off, and <em>we</em> stand by faith." "Let us not be highminded,
but fear; for if God spared not the natural
branches, take heed, lest he spare not us. Behold,
therefore, the goodness and severity of God; on them
which fell, severity; but, towards us, goodness, if
we continue in his goodness: otherwise, we also shall
be cut off." It will avail us little to confess Jesus
as the Messiah, if we are unconcerned to know and
practise the doctrines he has taught. But may we
"serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling."
"Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish
from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little."
"Blessed are all they that put their trust in him,"
for his word is fate; immutability seals, and eternity
executes, whatever he decrees.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXX.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my
servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved
of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the
Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of
the earth.&mdash;Isaiah xlix. 6.</p></blockquote>


<p>The descendants of Abraham, the friend of God,
were treated as the Lord's peculiar people; singled
out from other nations as the favourites of heaven,
the Lord was their lawgiver and king. No other
nation had God "so nigh unto them in all things that
they called upon him for," as the people of Israel.
To benefit them, the laws of nature were reversed,
and nations destroyed. They were employed by
Jehovah to punish the idolatrous people for their
crimes.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> They were selected to maintain the knowledge
and worship of the true God,<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> and to convey
his pure and holy law to remote generations. Thus
favoured and blessed, the Jews were accustomed contemptuously
to regard all other nations, as common
and unclean; they could not endure to have one stone
thrown down of the partition wall, which had so long
separated them from the Gentiles.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> They proudly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
enough appropriated to themselves all the blessings
connected with the appearance of the Messiah. But
it would be a light thing that Christ should become
Jehovah's servant, endure pain and scorn, merely to
"raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved
of Israel;" that nation which he knew would
so long despise and reject him. But Messiah was
given for "a light to the Gentiles," and Jehovah's
"salvation unto the ends of the earth." He has asked,
and received "the heathen for his inheritance, and
the uttermost parts of the earth for his possession."
"Yea, all nations shall be blessed in him;" for the root
of Jesse shall stand for "an ensign of the people,
and to him shall the Gentiles seek:" to his glorious
rest shall all nations flow. He shall have "dominion
from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of
the earth." "They that dwell in the wilderness,
shall bow before him; and his enemies lick the dust.
The kings of Tarshish and of the Isles shall bring
presents; the kings of Sheba and Seba, shall offer
gifts: yea, all kings shall fall down before him, all
nations shall serve him. For he shall deliver the
needy when he crieth; the poor also, and him that
hath no helper. He shall redeem their soul from
violence: and precious shall their blood be in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
sight. He shall live, and to him shall be given of the
gold of Seba: prayer also shall be made for him continually;
and daily shall he be praised. His name
shall endure for ever, his name shall be continued as
long as the sun: and men shall be blessed in him: all
nations shall call him blessed. Blessed be the Lord
God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous
things." Yes, Christ is Jehovah's servant, in whom his
soul delights; he has "put his spirit upon him, he
shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles;" "he has
given him for a covenant of the people, for a light of
the Gentiles." Numerous are the prophecies which
refer to the call of the heathen world, and Jesus who
declares himself the Messiah, is described in the New
Testament as "a light to lighten the Gentiles," as well
as "the glory of his people Israel." He preached himself
in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim,<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> and
Samaria:<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> the parting command he gave his disciples
was, that they should "go forth into all the world,
and preach the gospel to every creature." He endowed
them with the gift of tongues, to enable them
to preach the unsearchable riches of Christ to the
Gentiles. And they went forth and preached every
where, "the Lord working with them, and confirming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
the word with signs following." "The word of the
Lord went forth from Jerusalem;" it rapidly spread
through Jewry, Samaria, and Galilee. Distant cities
soon heard the glad tidings. Within thirty years
after their Lord's ascension, the faithful disciples had
preached the doctrines of the gospel at C&#230;sarea,
Damascus, Joppa, Antioch, Phrygia, Galatia, Derbe,
Corinth, Iconium, Ephesus, Macedonia, Cyprus,
Syria, Cilicia, Athens, Alexandria, at Rome, and
numerous other places.</p>

<p>The Christian faith was contrary to all existing
opinions, religions, and habits; and decidedly opposed
to the natural propensities of the human heart. Its
teachers were Jewish fishermen, tent-makers, and
tax-gatherers, poor and illiterate men,<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> unskilled in
artifice. They preached not merely amongst men as
simple as themselves, they taught at Athens and
Rome, the very seats of learning and philosophy;
they had to contend with men skilled in science, and
were opposed by long-established customs and habits.
The disciples had no eloquence to convince, no power
to awe, no wealth to bribe; they were opposed by
Jewish pride, Grecian philosophy, and worldly power;
yet the gospel flourished rapidly over all opposition and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
persecution: ancient prejudice fell before the religion
of Jesus; though it offered no worldly recompense to
its followers, yet it spread, notwithstanding the kings
and nobles of the earth set themselves in array
against it. "The stone cut out without hands is
become a great mountain, and shall fill the whole
earth." The standard of the cross has been planted
on every land. Nations, barbarous and learned, have
bowed before it; may it go on "conquering and to
conquer," till all nations and people call our Immanuel
blessed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXXI.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand,
until I make thine enemies thy footstool.&mdash;Psalm cx. 1.</p></blockquote>


<p>We here find Jehovah, <em>the</em> LORD, in the person of
God the Father, addressing the Adonai, my Lord, in
the person of God the Son, Christ Jesus <em>our</em> Lord.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
It is he, and he only, who shares the throne of Deity.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>
He who tabernacled on earth, "a man of sorrows and
acquainted with griefs," is now seated "on the right
hand of the Majesty on high. Far above all principality,
and power, and might, and dominion, and
every name that is named, not only in this world, but
in that which is to come." "To which of the angels
said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I
make thine enemies thy footstool?" "But unto the
Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever;
a sceptre of righteousness, is the sceptre of thy kingdom."
"This is he that liveth, and was dead, and
behold he is alive for evermore; and hath the keys of
hell and of death. He is Alpha and Omega, the
beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is,
and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty;"
"whom the heaven must receive, until the times
of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken
by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world
began." "The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at
my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
"For he hath appointed a day, in the which
he will judge the world in righteousness, by that man
whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance
unto all men, in that he hath raised him from
the dead." "For the Father judgeth no man, but
hath committed all judgment unto the Son; that all
men should honour the Son, even as they honour the
Father. He that honoureth not the Son, honoureth
not the Father which hath sent him." "But who may
abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand
when he appeareth?" Wo unto them who now dare
to raise their puny arm in rebellion against the
Majesty of heaven; who madly rush on the "thick
bosses of Jehovah's buckler;" "trample under foot
the blood of the Son of God;" and "heap unto themselves
wrath, against the day of wrath." Christ will
not always extend the golden sceptre of mercy, that
sinners "may touch and live." The day is coming,
when he will grasp the sword of justice, and arise to
"judge the world in righteousness." "Behold, he
cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and
they also which pierced him; and all kindreds of the
earth shall wail because of him." O that men "did
but know in this their day, the things that belong unto
their peace, before they are for ever hid from their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
eyes;" for "some shall awake to everlasting life, and
some to shame and everlasting contempt, but they that
be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament;
and they that turn many to righteousness, as the stars
for ever and ever." Ye watchmen on Zion's walls,
ye ministers of the everlasting gospel, O "heal not the
wound of the daughter of God's people slightly;" say
not, "Peace, peace, when there is no peace." "Cry
aloud, spare not; lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and
show the people their transgressions, and the house of
Jacob their sins." Shrink not back, like Jonah of
old, from delivering your Master's awful message. Be
ye faithful to your God, to your conscience, and to
souls. Let the sweet accents of mercy be heard,
while ye boldly unfurl the blood-stained banners of the
cross. Tell of the love and pity of him, who died
that we might live: "Who suffered, the just for the
unjust; to bring sinners unto God." "Pray them, in
Christ's stead, to be reconciled unto God;" and accept
of mercy while it may be found. Invite, exhort,
entreat them to flee from the wrath to come, to lay
down the weapons of their rebellion, and join your
royal Master's cause; to quit the enemy's camp, those
strong holds of sin and Satan, and rally round our
Immanuel's standard. "Proclaim the unsearchable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
riches of Christ," tell them "his yoke is easy, and
his burden light," that "his ways are ways of pleasantness,
and that all his paths are peace?" Tell them
"he now waits to be gracious, but that, ere long, the
Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven, with his
mighty angels in flaming fire, taking vengeance on
them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel
of our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall be punished with
everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord,
and from the glory of his power; when he shall come
to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all
them that believe." "He will swallow up death in
victory; the Lord God will wipe away tears from of
all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall be taken
away from off all the earth," for the Lord hath spoken
it. "It shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God;
we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is
the Lord; we have waited for him; we will be glad,
and rejoice in his salvation."</p>

is written in capital letters, it means Jehovah; and the name
of the Lord in small letters, signifies Adonai. The translators
intended to show, by this method, that in the original there is
a very material difference in the word. By the glorious incommunicable
name of Jehovah (translated LORD in capital
